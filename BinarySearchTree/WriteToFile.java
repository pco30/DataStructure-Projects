      		+ "We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\r\n"
      		+ "Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\r\n"
      		+ "rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\r\n"
      		+ "very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\r\n"
      		+ "waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a\r\n"
      		+ "national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\r\n"
      		+ "Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\r\n"
      		+ "don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\r\n"
      		+ "British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\r\n"
      		+ "regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\r\n"
      		+ "country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\r\n"
      		+ "nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\r\n"
      		+ "extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\r\n"
      		+ "Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\r\n"
      		+ "mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\r\n"
      		+ "not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\r\n"
      		+ "Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\r\n"
      		+ "with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\r\n"
      		+ "town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\r\n"
      		+ "here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\r\n"
      		+ "travels with Mina.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\r\n"
      		+ "Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\r\n"
      		+ "descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\r\n"
      		+ "East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\r\n"
      		+ "from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\r\n"
      		+ "the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\r\n"
      		+ "read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\r\n"
      		+ "horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\r\n"
      		+ "imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\r\n"
      		+ "must ask the Count all about them.)\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\r\n"
      		+ "all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\r\n"
      		+ "window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\r\n"
      		+ "the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\r\n"
      		+ "still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\r\n"
      		+ "knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\r\n"
      		+ "I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\r\n"
      		+ "which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\r\n"
      		+ "very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_Mem._, get recipe\r\n"
      		+ "for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\r\n"
      		+ "before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\r\n"
      		+ "the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\r\n"
      		+ "before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\r\n"
      		+ "more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\r\n"
      		+ "beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\r\n"
      		+ "top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\r\n"
      		+ "rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\r\n"
      		+ "of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\r\n"
      		+ "running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\r\n"
      		+ "station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\r\n"
      		+ "of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\r\n"
      		+ "saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\r\n"
      		+ "and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\r\n"
      		+ "looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\r\n"
      		+ "about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\r\n"
      		+ "and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\r\n"
      		+ "fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\r\n"
      		+ "were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\r\n"
      		+ "Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\r\n"
      		+ "hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\r\n"
      		+ "heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\r\n"
      		+ "nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\r\n"
      		+ "had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\r\n"
      		+ "picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\r\n"
      		+ "set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\r\n"
      		+ "however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\r\n"
      		+ "self-assertion.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\r\n"
      		+ "very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\r\n"
      		+ "Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\r\n"
      		+ "existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\r\n"
      		+ "of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\r\n"
      		+ "occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\r\n"
      		+ "a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\r\n"
      		+ "proper being assisted by famine and disease.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\r\n"
      		+ "found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\r\n"
      		+ "course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\r\n"
      		+ "evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\r\n"
      		+ "cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\r\n"
      		+ "undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\r\n"
      		+ "fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\r\n"
      		+ "said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She\r\n"
      		+ "smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\r\n"
      		+ "who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\r\n"
      		+ "a letter:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "     “My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\r\n"
      		+ "     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\r\n"

      		+ "making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\r\n"
      		+ "pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\r\n"
      		+ "true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\r\n"
      		+ "answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\r\n"
      		+ "lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\r\n"
      		+ "way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\r\n"
      		+ "was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\r\n"

      		+ "“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited\r\n"
      		+ "state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\r\n"
      		+ "mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\r\n"
      		+ "was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\r\n"
      		+ "that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\r\n"
      		+ "she asked again:\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.\r\n"
      		+ "She shook her head as she said again:\r\n"

      		+ "“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On\r\n"
      		+ "my saying that I did not understand, she went on:\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\r\n"
      		+ "the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\r\n"
      		+ "full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”\r\n"
      		+ "She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\r\n"
      		+ "without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\r\n"
      		+ "to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\r\n"
      		+ "ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\r\n"
      		+ "to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\r\n"
      		+ "tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\r\n"
      		+ "her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\r\n"
      		+ "dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\r\n"

      		+ "rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out\r\n"

      		+ "traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\r\n"
      		+ "am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\r\n"

      		+ "high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\r\n"
      		+ "hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\r\n"
      		+ "mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\r\n"
      		+ "naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\r\n"
      		+ "down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\r\n"
      		+ "left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\r\n"
      		+ "called “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\r\n"
      		+ "pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\r\n"
      		+ "style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\r\n"
      		+ "produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\r\n"
      		+ "disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\r\n"
      		+ "talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\r\n"
      		+ "now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\r\n"
      		+ "on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\r\n"
      		+ "“word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\r\n"
      		+ "pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\r\n"
      		+ "there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\r\n"
      		+ "dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\r\n"
      		+ "cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell,\r\n"
      		+ "“stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same\r\n"
      		+ "thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\r\n"
      		+ "either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\r\n"
      		+ "superstitions)\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\r\n"
      		+ "swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\r\n"
      		+ "pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\r\n"
      		+ "fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\r\n"
      		+ "first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\r\n"
      		+ "charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\r\n"
      		+ "just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\r\n"
      		+ "seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\r\n"
      		+ "could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\r\n"
      		+ "had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\r\n"
      		+ "themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\r\n"
      		+ "rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\r\n"
      		+ "centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\r\n"
      		+ "the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big\r\n"
      		+ "whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\r\n"
      		+ "our journey.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\r\n"
      		+ "scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\r\n"
      		+ "languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\r\n"
      		+ "been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\r\n"
      		+ "land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\r\n"
      		+ "with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\r\n"
      		+ "road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\r\n"
      		+ "plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\r\n"
      		+ "the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\r\n"
      		+ "green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,\r\n"
      		+ "losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\r\n"
      		+ "straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\r\n"
      		+ "hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\r\n"
      		+ "what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\r\n"
      		+ "time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\r\n"
      		+ "excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\r\n"
      		+ "snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\r\n"
      		+ "the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\r\n"
      		+ "in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\r\n"
      		+ "Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\r\n"
      		+ "and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\r\n"
      		+ "of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\r\n"
      		+ "and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\r\n"
      		+ "them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\r\n"
      		+ "deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\r\n"
      		+ "grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\r\n"
      		+ "pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\r\n"
      		+ "the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\r\n"
      		+ "mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\r\n"
      		+ "the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\r\n"
      		+ "we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\r\n"
      		+ "peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\r\n"
      		+ "be right before us:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Look! Isten szek!”--“God’s seat!”--and he crossed himself reverently.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\r\n"
      		+ "us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\r\n"
      		+ "emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\r\n"
      		+ "sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\r\n"
      		+ "we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\r\n"
      		+ "that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\r\n"
      		+ "and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\r\n"
      		+ "was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\r\n"
      		+ "turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\r\n"
      		+ "devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\r\n"
      		+ "many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\r\n"
      		+ "and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\r\n"
      		+ "shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\r\n"
      		+ "again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its\r\n"
      		+ "long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\r\n"
      		+ "road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\r\n"
      		+ "peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\r\n"
      		+ "coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\r\n"
      		+ "staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\r\n"
      		+ "and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\r\n"
      		+ "gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\r\n"
      		+ "ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\r\n"
      		+ "Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\r\n"
      		+ "late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\r\n"
      		+ "that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\r\n"
      		+ "greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\r\n"
      		+ "peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\r\n"
      		+ "grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\r\n"
      		+ "threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\r\n"
      		+ "Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\r\n"
      		+ "hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could\r\n"
      		+ "only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\r\n"
      		+ "but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not\r\n"
      		+ "walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he\r\n"
      		+ "evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\r\n"
      		+ "approving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters\r\n"
      		+ "before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s\r\n"
      		+ "pause to light his lamps.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\r\n"
      		+ "passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\r\n"
      		+ "though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\r\n"
      		+ "with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\r\n"
      		+ "to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\r\n"
      		+ "patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\r\n"
      		+ "hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\r\n"
      		+ "rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\r\n"
      		+ "stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\r\n"
      		+ "to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\r\n"
      		+ "side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\r\n"
      		+ "by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\r\n"
      		+ "upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\r\n"
      		+ "certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\r\n"
      		+ "faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\r\n"
      		+ "fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\r\n"
      		+ "Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\r\n"
      		+ "Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\r\n"
      		+ "passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\r\n"
      		+ "darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\r\n"
      		+ "happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\r\n"
      		+ "give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\r\n"
      		+ "some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\r\n"
      		+ "the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\r\n"
      		+ "air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\r\n"
      		+ "mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\r\n"
      		+ "into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\r\n"
      		+ "which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\r\n"
      		+ "glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\r\n"
      		+ "was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\r\n"
      		+ "hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\r\n"
      		+ "road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\r\n"
      		+ "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\r\n"
      		+ "my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\r\n"
      		+ "the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\r\n"
      		+ "could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\r\n"
      		+ "thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said\r\n"
      		+ "in German worse than my own:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\r\n"
      		+ "now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\r\n"
      		+ "the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\r\n"
      		+ "snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\r\n"
      		+ "amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\r\n"
      		+ "of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\r\n"
      		+ "us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\r\n"
      		+ "lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\r\n"
      		+ "splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\r\n"
      		+ "beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\r\n"
      		+ "could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\r\n"
      		+ "in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\r\n"
      		+ "deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he\r\n"
      		+ "spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\r\n"
      		+ "very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\r\n"
      		+ "companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "    “Denn die Todten reiten schnell”--\r\n"
      		+ "    (“For the dead travel fast.”)\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\r\n"
      		+ "gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\r\n"
      		+ "putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s\r\n"
      		+ "luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\r\n"
      		+ "handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\r\n"
      		+ "coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\r\n"
      		+ "hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\r\n"
      		+ "prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\r\n"
      		+ "swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\r\n"
      		+ "from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\r\n"
      		+ "against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\r\n"
      		+ "the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\r\n"
      		+ "on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\r\n"
      		+ "strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\r\n"
      		+ "over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\r\n"
      		+ "excellent German:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\r\n"
      		+ "care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\r\n"
      		+ "country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take\r\n"
      		+ "any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\r\n"
      		+ "little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\r\n"
      		+ "any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\r\n"
      		+ "unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\r\n"
      		+ "then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\r\n"
      		+ "again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\r\n"
      		+ "so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\r\n"
      		+ "I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\r\n"
      		+ "protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\r\n"
      		+ "delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\r\n"
      		+ "passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\r\n"
      		+ "within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\r\n"
      		+ "suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\r\n"
      		+ "recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\r\n"
      		+ "long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\r\n"
      		+ "another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\r\n"
      		+ "now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\r\n"
      		+ "it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\r\n"
      		+ "strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\r\n"
      		+ "quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\r\n"
      		+ "sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\r\n"
      		+ "side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\r\n"
      		+ "affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\r\n"
      		+ "jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\r\n"
      		+ "madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\r\n"
      		+ "from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\r\n"
      		+ "the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\r\n"
      		+ "to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\r\n"
      		+ "whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\r\n"
      		+ "doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\r\n"
      		+ "quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\r\n"
      		+ "took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\r\n"
      		+ "time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\r\n"
      		+ "narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\r\n"
      		+ "roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\r\n"
      		+ "rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\r\n"
      		+ "could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\r\n"
      		+ "rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\r\n"
      		+ "It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\r\n"
      		+ "so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\r\n"
      		+ "keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\r\n"
      		+ "fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\r\n"
      		+ "and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\r\n"
      		+ "grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\r\n"
      		+ "however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\r\n"
      		+ "left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\r\n"
      		+ "driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\r\n"
      		+ "jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\r\n"
      		+ "what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\r\n"
      		+ "I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\r\n"
      		+ "his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\r\n"
      		+ "and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\r\n"
      		+ "endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\r\n"
      		+ "Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\r\n"
      		+ "around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where\r\n"
      		+ "the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\r\n"
      		+ "to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\r\n"
      		+ "formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\r\n"
      		+ "effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\r\n"
      		+ "for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\r\n"
      		+ "as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\r\n"
      		+ "straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\r\n"
      		+ "flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\r\n"
      		+ "wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\r\n"
      		+ "had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\r\n"
      		+ "than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\r\n"
      		+ "for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\r\n"
      		+ "then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\r\n"
      		+ "jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\r\n"
      		+ "around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\r\n"
      		+ "with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\r\n"
      		+ "terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\r\n"
      		+ "For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\r\n"
      		+ "feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\r\n"
      		+ "their true import.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\r\n"
      		+ "some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\r\n"
      		+ "looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\r\n"
      		+ "but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\r\n"
      		+ "had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\r\n"
      		+ "it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\r\n"
      		+ "ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\r\n"
      		+ "calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\r\n"
      		+ "to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\r\n"
      		+ "not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\r\n"
      		+ "looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\r\n"
      		+ "long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\r\n"
      		+ "fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\r\n"
      		+ "the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\r\n"
      		+ "wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\r\n"
      		+ "dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\r\n"
      		+ "seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\r\n"
      		+ "darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\r\n"
      		+ "ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\r\n"
      		+ "always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\r\n"
      		+ "driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\r\n"
      		+ "vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\r\n"
      		+ "and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\r\n"
      		+ "sky.\r\n"

      		+ "_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\r\n"
      		+ "awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\r\n"
      		+ "the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\r\n"
      		+ "ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\r\n"
      		+ "it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\r\n"
      		+ "to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\r\n"
      		+ "strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\r\n"
      		+ "crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\r\n"
      		+ "them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\r\n"
      		+ "studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\r\n"
      		+ "massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\r\n"
      		+ "massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\r\n"
      		+ "weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\r\n"
      		+ "reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\r\n"
      		+ "of the dark openings.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\r\n"
      		+ "or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\r\n"
      		+ "window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\r\n"
      		+ "time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\r\n"
      		+ "me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\r\n"
      		+ "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\r\n"
      		+ "customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to\r\n"
      		+ "explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s\r\n"
      		+ "clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\r\n"
      		+ "London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\r\n"
      		+ "full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\r\n"
      		+ "I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\r\n"
      		+ "expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\r\n"
      		+ "the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\r\n"
      		+ "in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\r\n"
      		+ "pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\r\n"
      		+ "and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\r\n"
      		+ "wait the coming of the morning.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\r\n"
      		+ "behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\r\n"
      		+ "light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\r\n"
      		+ "massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\r\n"
      		+ "of long disuse, and the great door swung back.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\r\n"
      		+ "moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\r\n"
      		+ "of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\r\n"
      		+ "lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\r\n"
      		+ "throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\r\n"
      		+ "open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\r\n"
      		+ "gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no\r\n"
      		+ "motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\r\n"
      		+ "gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\r\n"
      		+ "I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\r\n"
      		+ "holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\r\n"
      		+ "an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\r\n"
      		+ "ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\r\n"
      		+ "happiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\r\n"
      		+ "that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\r\n"
      		+ "for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\r\n"
      		+ "speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\r\n"
      		+ "the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was\r\n"
      		+ "speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\r\n"
      		+ "took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\r\n"
      		+ "protested but he insisted:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\r\n"
      		+ "available. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying\r\n"
      		+ "my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\r\n"
      		+ "along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\r\n"
      		+ "heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\r\n"
      		+ "to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\r\n"
      		+ "and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\r\n"
      		+ "flamed and flared.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\r\n"
      		+ "the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\r\n"
      		+ "by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\r\n"
      		+ "through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\r\n"
      		+ "welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\r\n"
      		+ "another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\r\n"
      		+ "fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\r\n"
      		+ "left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\r\n"
      		+ "door:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\r\n"
      		+ "toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\r\n"
      		+ "into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have\r\n"
      		+ "dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\r\n"
      		+ "I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\r\n"
      		+ "toilet, I went into the other room.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\r\n"
      		+ "great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\r\n"
      		+ "his hand to the table, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\r\n"
      		+ "me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\r\n"
      		+ "He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\r\n"
      		+ "it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\r\n"
      		+ "pleasure.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\r\n"
      		+ "sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\r\n"
      		+ "come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\r\n"
      		+ "whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\r\n"
      		+ "and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\r\n"
      		+ "discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\r\n"
      		+ "be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\r\n"
      		+ "your instructions in all matters.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\r\n"
      		+ "fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\r\n"
      		+ "and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\r\n"
      		+ "my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\r\n"
      		+ "questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\r\n"
      		+ "experienced.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn\r\n"
      		+ "up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\r\n"
      		+ "at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\r\n"
      		+ "opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\r\n"
      		+ "physiognomy.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\r\n"
      		+ "thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\r\n"
      		+ "hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\r\n"
      		+ "eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\r\n"
      		+ "hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\r\n"
      		+ "could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\r\n"
      		+ "cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\r\n"
      		+ "the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\r\n"
      		+ "man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\r\n"
      		+ "extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\r\n"
      		+ "though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\r\n"
      		+ "in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\r\n"
      		+ "them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\r\n"
      		+ "coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\r\n"
      		+ "the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\r\n"
      		+ "point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\r\n"
      		+ "repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\r\n"
      		+ "horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\r\n"
      		+ "not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\r\n"
      		+ "grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\r\n"
      		+ "protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\r\n"
      		+ "fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\r\n"
      		+ "window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\r\n"
      		+ "strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\r\n"
      		+ "down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes\r\n"
      		+ "gleamed, and he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!”\r\n"
      		+ "Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\r\n"
      		+ "added:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\r\n"
      		+ "hunter.” Then he rose and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\r\n"
      		+ "shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\r\n"
      		+ "so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me\r\n"
      		+ "himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\r\n"
      		+ "which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\r\n"
      		+ "sake of those dear to me!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"

      		+ "_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\r\n"
      		+ "last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\r\n"
      		+ "own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\r\n"
      		+ "supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\r\n"
      		+ "pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\r\n"
      		+ "was written:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.” I set to and\r\n"
      		+ "enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\r\n"
      		+ "might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\r\n"
      		+ "There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\r\n"
      		+ "extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\r\n"
      		+ "is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\r\n"
      		+ "The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\r\n"
      		+ "my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\r\n"
      		+ "been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\r\n"
      		+ "though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\r\n"
      		+ "but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\r\n"
      		+ "the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\r\n"
      		+ "table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\r\n"
      		+ "could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\r\n"
      		+ "anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\r\n"
      		+ "Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\r\n"
      		+ "breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I had\r\n"
      		+ "it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\r\n"
      		+ "the castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There was\r\n"
      		+ "absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\r\n"
      		+ "materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\r\n"
      		+ "library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\r\n"
      		+ "books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\r\n"
      		+ "newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\r\n"
      		+ "and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\r\n"
      		+ "were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\r\n"
      		+ "economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\r\n"
      		+ "and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\r\n"
      		+ "London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the\r\n"
      		+ "Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\r\n"
      		+ "Law List.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\r\n"
      		+ "entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\r\n"
      		+ "night’s rest. Then he went on:--\r\n"

      		+ "enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\r\n"
      		+ "and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\r\n"
      		+ "know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\r\n"
      		+ "like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\r\n"
      		+ "speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long\r\n"
      		+ "master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\r\n"
      		+ "be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\r\n"
      		+ "Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\r\n"
      		+ "shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\r\n"
      		+ "learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\r\n"
      		+ "error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\r\n"
      		+ "away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\r\n"
      		+ "important affairs in hand.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\r\n"
      		+ "come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and\r\n"
      		+ "added:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\r\n"
      		+ "locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\r\n"
      		+ "all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\r\n"
      		+ "my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of\r\n"
      		+ "this, and then he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\r\n"
      		+ "not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\r\n"
      		+ "what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\r\n"
      		+ "what strange things there may be.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\r\n"
      		+ "talk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\r\n"
      		+ "things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\r\n"
      		+ "Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\r\n"
      		+ "pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\r\n"
      		+ "frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\r\n"
      		+ "him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\r\n"
      		+ "instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\r\n"
      		+ "flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\r\n"
      		+ "certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\r\n"
      		+ "are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\r\n"
      		+ "where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he\r\n"
      		+ "went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be\r\n"
      		+ "but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\r\n"
      		+ "Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\r\n"
      		+ "in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\r\n"
      		+ "patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\r\n"
      		+ "Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\r\n"
      		+ "to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\r\n"
      		+ "their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\r\n"
      		+ "destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\r\n"
      		+ "was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\r\n"
      		+ "sheltered in the friendly soil.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\r\n"
      		+ "there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”\r\n"
      		+ "The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\r\n"
      		+ "sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\r\n"
      		+ "appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\r\n"
      		+ "can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\r\n"
      		+ "would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\r\n"
      		+ "marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\r\n"
      		+ "even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\r\n"
      		+ "find these places again?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even\r\n"
      		+ "to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you\r\n"
      		+ "have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\r\n"
      		+ "own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\r\n"
      		+ "order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\r\n"
      		+ "passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\r\n"
      		+ "lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\r\n"
      		+ "in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\r\n"
      		+ "reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I\r\n"
      		+ "came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\r\n"
      		+ "went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\r\n"
      		+ "everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\r\n"
      		+ "surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\r\n"
      		+ "subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\r\n"
      		+ "more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\r\n"
      		+ "I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\r\n"
      		+ "fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\r\n"
      		+ "in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\r\n"
      		+ "other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\r\n"
      		+ "Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\r\n"
      		+ "necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\r\n"
      		+ "Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\r\n"
      		+ "place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\r\n"
      		+ "inscribe here:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\r\n"
      		+ "was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\r\n"
      		+ "built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\r\n"
      		+ "years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\r\n"
      		+ "rust.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\r\n"
      		+ "Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\r\n"
      		+ "the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\r\n"
      		+ "the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\r\n"
      		+ "make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\r\n"
      		+ "small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\r\n"
      		+ "flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\r\n"
      		+ "periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone\r\n"
      		+ "immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\r\n"
      		+ "iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\r\n"
      		+ "church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\r\n"
      		+ "to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\r\n"
      		+ "various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\r\n"
      		+ "way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\r\n"
      		+ "be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\r\n"
      		+ "large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\r\n"
      		+ "asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I had finished, he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\r\n"
      		+ "live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\r\n"
      		+ "day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\r\n"
      		+ "also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\r\n"
      		+ "not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\r\n"
      		+ "gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\r\n"
      		+ "sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\r\n"
      		+ "and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\r\n"
      		+ "attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\r\n"
      		+ "shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\r\n"
      		+ "battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\r\n"
      		+ "be alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look\r\n"
      		+ "did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\r\n"
      		+ "smile look malignant and saturnine.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\r\n"
      		+ "together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\r\n"
      		+ "the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\r\n"
      		+ "England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\r\n"
      		+ "certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\r\n"
      		+ "that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\r\n"
      		+ "estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\r\n"
      		+ "Yorkshire coast.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he\r\n"
      		+ "said; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\r\n"
      		+ "am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into\r\n"
      		+ "the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\r\n"
      		+ "Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\r\n"
      		+ "home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\r\n"
      		+ "After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\r\n"
      		+ "me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\r\n"
      		+ "after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\r\n"
      		+ "say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in\r\n"
      		+ "every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\r\n"
      		+ "me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\r\n"
      		+ "the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\r\n"
      		+ "They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\r\n"
      		+ "the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\r\n"
      		+ "tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\r\n"
      		+ "can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\r\n"
      		+ "with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\r\n"
      		+ "Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\r\n"
      		+ "long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\r\n"
      		+ "England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\r\n"
      		+ "us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\r\n"
      		+ "notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\r\n"
      		+ "warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\r\n"
      		+ "written of this day.\r\n"

      		+ "_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\r\n"
      		+ "diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\r\n"
      		+ "there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\r\n"
      		+ "cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\r\n"
      		+ "never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\r\n"
      		+ "me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\r\n"
      		+ "could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\r\n"
      		+ "and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\r\n"
      		+ "me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\r\n"
      		+ "imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\r\n"
      		+ "at once how I stand--or seem to.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\r\n"
      		+ "not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\r\n"
      		+ "and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\r\n"
      		+ "and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for\r\n"
      		+ "it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\r\n"
      		+ "covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\r\n"
      		+ "but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s\r\n"
      		+ "salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\r\n"
      		+ "This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\r\n"
      		+ "could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\r\n"
      		+ "the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\r\n"
      		+ "sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\r\n"
      		+ "the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\r\n"
      		+ "feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\r\n"
      		+ "the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\r\n"
      		+ "trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\r\n"
      		+ "round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\r\n"
      		+ "eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\r\n"
      		+ "my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\r\n"
      		+ "held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\r\n"
      		+ "so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more\r\n"
      		+ "dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving\r\n"
      		+ "glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the\r\n"
      		+ "mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and\r\n"
      		+ "opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\r\n"
      		+ "out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\r\n"
      		+ "of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\r\n"
      		+ "annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\r\n"
      		+ "the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\r\n"
      		+ "not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\r\n"
      		+ "as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\r\n"
      		+ "peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\r\n"
      		+ "went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\r\n"
      		+ "view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\r\n"
      		+ "of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\r\n"
      		+ "stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\r\n"
      		+ "touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\r\n"
      		+ "tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\r\n"
      		+ "there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\r\n"
      		+ "the forests.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\r\n"
      		+ "explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\r\n"
      		+ "bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\r\n"

      		+ "few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\r\n"
      		+ "as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\r\n"
      		+ "that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\r\n"
      		+ "anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\r\n"
      		+ "am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\r\n"
      		+ "one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\r\n"
      		+ "the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\r\n"
      		+ "himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\r\n"
      		+ "me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\r\n"
      		+ "plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\r\n"
      		+ "open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\r\n"
      		+ "or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\r\n"
      		+ "shall need, all my brains to get through.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\r\n"
      		+ "shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\r\n"
      		+ "the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\r\n"
      		+ "the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\r\n"
      		+ "thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\r\n"
      		+ "through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\r\n"
      		+ "dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\r\n"
      		+ "menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\r\n"
      		+ "This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\r\n"
      		+ "must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\r\n"
      		+ "brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\r\n"
      		+ "mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\r\n"
      		+ "hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\r\n"
      		+ "coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\r\n"
      		+ "crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\r\n"
      		+ "that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\r\n"
      		+ "comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\r\n"
      		+ "which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\r\n"
      		+ "should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\r\n"
      		+ "is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\r\n"
      		+ "a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\r\n"
      		+ "time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\r\n"
      		+ "mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\r\n"
      		+ "Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\r\n"

      		+ "First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\r\n"
      		+ "the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\r\n"
      		+ "London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\r\n"
      		+ "here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\r\n"
      		+ "sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\r\n"
      		+ "resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\r\n"
      		+ "served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\r\n"
      		+ "have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\r\n"
      		+ "seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\r\n"

      		+ "Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\r\n"
      		+ "ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that\r\n"
      		+ "certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\r\n"
      		+ "agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\r\n"
      		+ "instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\r\n"

      		+ "“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\r\n"

      		+ "difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\r\n"
      		+ "against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\r\n"
      		+ "and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\r\n"
      		+ "wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\r\n"
      		+ "foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\r\n"
      		+ "evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\r\n"
      		+ "wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\r\n"
      		+ "spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\r\n"

      		+ "“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\r\n"

      		+ "I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\r\n"
      		+ "sending letters to anybody.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\r\n"

      		+ "“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\r\n"
      		+ "employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\r\n"
      		+ "it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\r\n"
      		+ "stinted. Is it not so?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not\r\n"

      		+ "Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\r\n"
      		+ "which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\r\n"
      		+ "could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\r\n"
      		+ "mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\r\n"

      		+ "other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\r\n"
      		+ "friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\r\n"
      		+ "home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\r\n"
      		+ "note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\r\n"
      		+ "post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\r\n"
      		+ "with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\r\n"
      		+ "as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\r\n"
      		+ "he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\r\n"
      		+ "now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\r\n"
      		+ "to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\r\n"
      		+ "did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\r\n"
      		+ "book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\r\n"
      		+ "some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\r\n"
      		+ "own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\r\n"
      		+ "had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\r\n"
      		+ "were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\r\n"
      		+ "under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\r\n"
      		+ "I could.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\r\n"

      		+ "Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\r\n"
      		+ "bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\r\n"
      		+ "about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\r\n"
      		+ "seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\r\n"
      		+ "to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\r\n"
      		+ "hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\r\n"
      		+ "them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\r\n"
      		+ "evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door he\r\n"
      		+ "turned, and after a moment’s pause said:--\r\n"

      		+ "“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\r\n"
      		+ "seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\r\n"
      		+ "chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\r\n"
      		+ "many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\r\n"

      		+ "haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\r\n"
      		+ "safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished his\r\n"
      		+ "speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\r\n"
      		+ "washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\r\n"
      		+ "dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\r\n"
      		+ "and mystery which seemed closing around me.\r\n"

      		+ "so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\r\n"
      		+ "somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\r\n"

      		+ "He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\r\n"
      		+ "deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\r\n"
      		+ "had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\r\n"
      		+ "avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\r\n"
      		+ "knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\r\n"
      		+ "explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\r\n"
      		+ "taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\r\n"
      		+ "expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\r\n"
      		+ "stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\r\n"
      		+ "pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\r\n"
      		+ "door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s\r\n"
      		+ "room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\r\n"
      		+ "escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\r\n"
      		+ "and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\r\n"
      		+ "small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\r\n"
      		+ "them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\r\n"
      		+ "however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\r\n"
      		+ "and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\r\n"
      		+ "from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\r\n"
      		+ "rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\r\n"
      		+ "again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\r\n"
      		+ "I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\r\n"
      		+ "than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\r\n"
      		+ "see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\r\n"
      		+ "windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\r\n"
      		+ "side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\r\n"
      		+ "was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\r\n"
      		+ "quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\r\n"
      		+ "bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\r\n"
      		+ "impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\r\n"
      		+ "west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\r\n"
      		+ "mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\r\n"
      		+ "mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\r\n"
      		+ "crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\r\n"
      		+ "occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\r\n"
      		+ "comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\r\n"
      		+ "yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\r\n"
      		+ "see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\r\n"
      		+ "all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\r\n"
      		+ "lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\r\n"
      		+ "glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\r\n"
      		+ "which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\r\n"
      		+ "than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\r\n"
      		+ "presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\r\n"
      		+ "found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\r\n"
      		+ "table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\r\n"
      		+ "thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\r\n"
      		+ "diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\r\n"
      		+ "nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\r\n"
      		+ "senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\r\n"

      		+ "moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\r\n"

      		+ "and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\r\n"

      		+ "the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\r\n"
      		+ "asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\r\n"
      		+ "real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\r\n"
      		+ "morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\r\n"
      		+ "came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\r\n"
      		+ "my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\r\n"
      		+ "dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\r\n"
      		+ "their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\r\n"
      		+ "when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\r\n"
      		+ "no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\r\n"
      		+ "time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\r\n"
      		+ "noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\r\n"
      		+ "almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\r\n"
      		+ "fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\r\n"
      		+ "like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\r\n"
      		+ "in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\r\n"
      		+ "moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\r\n"
      		+ "pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\r\n"
      		+ "about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\r\n"
      		+ "deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\r\n"
      		+ "kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\r\n"
      		+ "day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\r\n"
      		+ "They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\r\n"
      		+ "silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\r\n"
      		+ "come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\r\n"
      		+ "tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\r\n"
      		+ "The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\r\n"
      		+ "on. One said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\r\n"
      		+ "begin.” The other added:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,\r\n"
      		+ "looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\r\n"
      		+ "The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\r\n"
      		+ "of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\r\n"
      		+ "the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\r\n"
      		+ "underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\r\n"
      		+ "the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\r\n"
      		+ "gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\r\n"
      		+ "and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\r\n"
      		+ "like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\r\n"
      		+ "on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\r\n"
      		+ "teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\r\n"
      		+ "my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\r\n"
      		+ "paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\r\n"
      		+ "her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\r\n"
      		+ "skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that\r\n"
      		+ "is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\r\n"
      		+ "shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\r\n"
      		+ "and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\r\n"
      		+ "I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\r\n"
      		+ "heart.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\r\n"
      		+ "lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\r\n"
      		+ "being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\r\n"
      		+ "saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\r\n"
      		+ "giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\r\n"
      		+ "white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\r\n"
      		+ "passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\r\n"
      		+ "the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\r\n"
      		+ "in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\r\n"
      		+ "face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\r\n"
      		+ "the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\r\n"
      		+ "of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\r\n"
      		+ "from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\r\n"
      		+ "them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\r\n"
      		+ "wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\r\n"
      		+ "I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\r\n"
      		+ "how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,\r\n"
      		+ "with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women\r\n"
      		+ "joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\r\n"
      		+ "room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\r\n"
      		+ "of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\r\n"
      		+ "and said in a soft whisper:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\r\n"
      		+ "not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\r\n"
      		+ "kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\r\n"
      		+ "to be done.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,\r\n"
      		+ "as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\r\n"
      		+ "moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\r\n"
      		+ "nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\r\n"
      		+ "ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\r\n"
      		+ "half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\r\n"
      		+ "horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\r\n"
      		+ "bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\r\n"
      		+ "without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\r\n"
      		+ "moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\r\n"
      		+ "dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\r\n"

      		+ "could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\r\n"
      		+ "glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\r\n"
      		+ "their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\r\n"
      		+ "movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\r\n"
      		+ "and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\r\n"
      		+ "there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\r\n"
      		+ "By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\r\n"
      		+ "I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\r\n"
      		+ "the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\r\n"
      		+ "though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\r\n"
      		+ "leaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle\r\n"
      		+ "wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\r\n"

      		+ "Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\r\n"
      		+ "Count.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\r\n"
      		+ "determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s\r\n"
      		+ "room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\r\n"
      		+ "evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\r\n"
      		+ "down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that\r\n"
      		+ "was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\r\n"
      		+ "remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\r\n"
      		+ "stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\r\n"
      		+ "enough where to find the monster I sought.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\r\n"
      		+ "was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\r\n"
      		+ "places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\r\n"
      		+ "I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\r\n"
      		+ "something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\r\n"
      		+ "but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\r\n"
      		+ "and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\r\n"
      		+ "and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\r\n"
      		+ "ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\r\n"
      		+ "corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\r\n"
      		+ "burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\r\n"
      		+ "underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\r\n"
      		+ "simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\r\n"
      		+ "repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\r\n"
      		+ "me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\r\n"
      		+ "coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\r\n"
      		+ "horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\r\n"
      		+ "key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\r\n"
      		+ "on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\r\n"
      		+ "was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\r\n"
      		+ "he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\r\n"
      		+ "create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\r\n"
      		+ "helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\r\n"
      		+ "to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\r\n"
      		+ "but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\r\n"
      		+ "cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\r\n"
      		+ "hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\r\n"
      		+ "upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\r\n"
      		+ "merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\r\n"
      		+ "hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\r\n"
      		+ "caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\r\n"
      		+ "thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\r\n"
      		+ "blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\r\n"
      		+ "own in the nethermost hell.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\r\n"
      		+ "on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\r\n"
      		+ "waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\r\n"
      		+ "closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\r\n"
      		+ "cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\r\n"
      		+ "spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\r\n"
      		+ "contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s\r\n"
      		+ "room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\r\n"
      		+ "With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\r\n"
      		+ "key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\r\n"
      		+ "have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\r\n"
      		+ "the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\r\n"
      		+ "dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\r\n"
      		+ "run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\r\n"
      		+ "but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\r\n"
      		+ "door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\r\n"
      		+ "the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\r\n"
      		+ "hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\r\n"
      		+ "round me more closely.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\r\n"
      		+ "and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\r\n"
      		+ "with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\r\n"
      		+ "box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\r\n"
      		+ "along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\r\n"
      		+ "in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\r\n"
      		+ "shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\r\n"
      		+ "the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\r\n"
      		+ "distance.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\r\n"
      		+ "farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\r\n"
      		+ "me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\r\n"

      		+ "lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\r\n"
      		+ "which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\r\n"
      		+ "Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\r\n"
      		+ "harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\r\n"
      		+ "view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\r\n"
      		+ "beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\r\n"
      		+ "on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\r\n"
      		+ "see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\r\n"
      		+ "red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\r\n"
      		+ "pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\r\n"
      		+ "Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\r\n"
      		+ "“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\r\n"
      		+ "ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\r\n"
      		+ "a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\r\n"
      		+ "the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\r\n"
      		+ "graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\r\n"

      		+ "stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\r\n"

      		+ "destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\r\n"
      		+ "out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\r\n"
      		+ "them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\r\n"
      		+ "looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\r\n"
      		+ "sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\r\n"
      		+ "book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\r\n"

      		+ "the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\r\n"
      		+ "of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\r\n"
      		+ "and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\r\n"

      		+ "side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\r\n"
      		+ "which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\r\n"
      		+ "it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\r\n"
      		+ "mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\r\n"

      		+ "He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\r\n"

      		+ "nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\r\n"
      		+ "fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\r\n"
      		+ "person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\r\n"

      		+ "experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\r\n"
      		+ "been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\r\n"
      		+ "August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\r\n"

      		+ "Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\r\n"

      		+ "“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\r\n"
      		+ "afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\r\n"
      		+ "churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\r\n"
      		+ "sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\r\n"
      		+ "“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\r\n"
      		+ "blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\r\n"
      		+ "language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once\r\n"
      		+ "made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\r\n"
      		+ "kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\r\n"
      		+ "manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\r\n"
      		+ "beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\r\n"
      		+ "there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\r\n"
      		+ "churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\r\n"
      		+ "mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\r\n"
      		+ "downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\r\n"
      		+ "purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\r\n"

      		+ "sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\r\n"

      		+ "there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different\r\n"
      		+ "classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\r\n"
      		+ "The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\r\n"
      		+ "was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\r\n"
      		+ "the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\r\n"
      		+ "were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\r\n"
      		+ "which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\r\n"
      		+ "few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\r\n"
      		+ "schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\r\n"
      		+ "foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\r\n"
      		+ "comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\r\n"
      		+ "her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\r\n"
      		+ "was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\r\n"

      		+ "Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite\r\n"
      		+ "oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\r\n"
      		+ "inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\r\n"
      		+ "band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\r\n"
      		+ "great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a\r\n"
      		+ "strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\r\n"
      		+ "carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\r\n"
      		+ "time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\r\n"
      		+ "the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\r\n"
      		+ "growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\r\n"
      		+ "the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\r\n"
      		+ "White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\r\n"
      		+ "shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\r\n"
      		+ "the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\r\n"
      		+ "of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\r\n"
      		+ "force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\r\n"
      		+ "or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\r\n"
      		+ "to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\r\n"
      		+ "fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\r\n"
      		+ "the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\r\n"
      		+ "drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\r\n"
      		+ "so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\r\n"
      		+ "imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\r\n"
      		+ "touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\r\n"
      		+ "a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\r\n"
      		+ "cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\r\n"
      		+ "lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\r\n"
      		+ "of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\r\n"
      		+ "of the footsteps of the storm.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\r\n"
      		+ "absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\r\n"
      		+ "each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\r\n"
      		+ "a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\r\n"
      		+ "the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\r\n"
      		+ "Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\r\n"
      		+ "tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\r\n"
      		+ "the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\r\n"
      		+ "Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\r\n"
      		+ "with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\r\n"
      		+ "of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\r\n"
      		+ "piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\r\n"
      		+ "joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\r\n"
      		+ "with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\r\n"
      		+ "earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\r\n"
      		+ "and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\r\n"
      		+ "realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\r\n"
      		+ "port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\r\n"
      		+ "to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\r\n"
      		+ "it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\r\n"
      		+ "harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\r\n"
      		+ "great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\r\n"
      		+ "visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\r\n"
      		+ "speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,\r\n"
      		+ "if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\r\n"
      		+ "any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\r\n"
      		+ "like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\r\n"
      		+ "for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\r\n"
      		+ "booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\r\n"
      		+ "than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\r\n"
      		+ "mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\r\n"
      		+ "breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\r\n"
      		+ "of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\r\n"
      		+ "the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\r\n"
      		+ "swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\r\n"
      		+ "gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\r\n"
      		+ "shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\r\n"
      		+ "corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\r\n"
      		+ "motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\r\n"
      		+ "awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\r\n"
      		+ "found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\r\n"
      		+ "all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\r\n"
      		+ "schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\r\n"
      		+ "that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\r\n"
      		+ "storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\r\n"
      		+ "Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\r\n"
      		+ "the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\r\n"
      		+ "“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\r\n"
      		+ "the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\r\n"
      		+ "if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\r\n"
      		+ "on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\r\n"
      		+ "hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\r\n"
      		+ "tombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in\r\n"
      		+ "the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\r\n"
      		+ "has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\r\n"
      		+ "intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\r\n"
      		+ "all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\r\n"
      		+ "out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\r\n"
      		+ "side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\r\n"
      		+ "first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\r\n"
      		+ "the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\r\n"
      		+ "light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\r\n"
      		+ "when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\r\n"
      		+ "once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\r\n"
      		+ "curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\r\n"
      		+ "round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\r\n"
      		+ "correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\r\n"
      		+ "When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\r\n"
      		+ "whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\r\n"
      		+ "courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\r\n"
      		+ "to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\r\n"
      		+ "whilst actually lashed to the wheel.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\r\n"
      		+ "not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\r\n"
      		+ "by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\r\n"
      		+ "the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\r\n"
      		+ "was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\r\n"
      		+ "the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\r\n"
      		+ "the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\r\n"
      		+ "the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\r\n"
      		+ "was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\r\n"
      		+ "state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\r\n"
      		+ "Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\r\n"
      		+ "examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\r\n"
      		+ "pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\r\n"
      		+ "paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\r\n"
      		+ "the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\r\n"
      		+ "teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\r\n"
      		+ "complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\r\n"
      		+ "claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\r\n"
      		+ "derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\r\n"
      		+ "law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\r\n"
      		+ "completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\r\n"
      		+ "statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\r\n"
      		+ "delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\r\n"
      		+ "that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\r\n"
      		+ "he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\r\n"
      		+ "noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\r\n"
      		+ "await inquest.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\r\n"
      		+ "crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\r\n"

      		+ "_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\r\n"
      		+ "storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\r\n"
      		+ "turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\r\n"
      		+ "_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\r\n"
      		+ "small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\r\n"

      		+ "possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\r\n"
      		+ "acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\r\n"
      		+ "paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\r\n"
      		+ "the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\r\n"
      		+ "most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\r\n"
      		+ "existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they\r\n"
      		+ "are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\r\n"

      		+ "S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\r\n"

      		+ "possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\r\n"
      		+ "is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\r\n"
      		+ "mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\r\n"
      		+ "dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,\r\n"

      		+ "dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\r\n"
      		+ "and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\r\n"
      		+ "except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\r\n"
      		+ "and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s\r\n"
      		+ "Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over\r\n"
      		+ "the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have\r\n"
      		+ "shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless\r\n"
      		+ "them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,\r\n"
      		+ "and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was\r\n"
      		+ "really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.\r\n"
      		+ "The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay\r\n"
      		+ "for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I\r\n"
      		+ "know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that\r\n"
      		+ "some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new\r\n"
      		+ "class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be\r\n"

      		+ "women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or\r\n"
      		+ "accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to\r\n"
      		+ "accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make\r\n"
      		+ "of it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,\r\n"

      		+ "I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an\r\n"

      		+ "Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear\r\n"
      		+ "upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,\r\n"
      		+ "so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed\r\n"
      		+ "was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The\r\n"
      		+ "door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her\r\n"
      		+ "mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some\r\n"
      		+ "clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it\r\n"

      		+ "dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.\r\n"
      		+ "Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said\r\n"
      		+ "to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran\r\n"
      		+ "downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in\r\n"
      		+ "all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\r\n"
      		+ "chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It\r\n"
      		+ "was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people\r\n"
      		+ "of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what\r\n"
      		+ "might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a\r\n"
      		+ "big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the\r\n"
      		+ "Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North\r\n"
      		+ "Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At\r\n"
      		+ "the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to\r\n"
      		+ "the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucy\r\n"
      		+ "in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,\r\n"
      		+ "driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of\r\n"
      		+ "light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see\r\n"
      		+ "nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all\r\n"
      		+ "around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey\r\n"
      		+ "coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as\r\n"
      		+ "a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually\r\n"
      		+ "visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for\r\n"
      		+ "there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a\r\n"
      		+ "half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too\r\n"
      		+ "quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost\r\n"
      		+ "immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\r\n"
      		+ "the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\r\n"
      		+ "whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\r\n"
      		+ "glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\r\n"
      		+ "fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\r\n"
      		+ "Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\r\n"
      		+ "that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The\r\n"
      		+ "time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\r\n"
      		+ "came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\r\n"
      		+ "gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\r\n"
      		+ "lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\r\n"
      		+ "to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\r\n"
      		+ "close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\r\n"
      		+ "was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\r\n"
      		+ "half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and\r\n"
      		+ "something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\r\n"
      		+ "and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\r\n"
      		+ "entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\r\n"
      		+ "the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\r\n"
      		+ "view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\r\n"
      		+ "that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\r\n"
      		+ "of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\r\n"
      		+ "thing about.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips\r\n"
      		+ "were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in\r\n"
      		+ "long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\r\n"
      		+ "breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\r\n"
      		+ "collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\r\n"
      		+ "there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\r\n"
      		+ "flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\r\n"
      		+ "for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\r\n"
      		+ "unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\r\n"
      		+ "have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\r\n"
      		+ "throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\r\n"
      		+ "and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\r\n"
      		+ "became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\r\n"
      		+ "had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began\r\n"
      		+ "very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\r\n"
      		+ "became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\r\n"
      		+ "occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\r\n"
      		+ "reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\r\n"
      		+ "till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\r\n"
      		+ "to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\r\n"
      		+ "have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\r\n"
      		+ "unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\r\n"
      		+ "trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\r\n"
      		+ "me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\r\n"
      		+ "passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\r\n"
      		+ "stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\r\n"
      		+ "However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\r\n"
      		+ "was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\r\n"
      		+ "mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\r\n"
      		+ "one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\r\n"
      		+ "a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\r\n"
      		+ "us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\r\n"
      		+ "there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in\r\n"
      		+ "Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I\r\n"
      		+ "should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\r\n"
      		+ "health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\r\n"
      		+ "in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our\r\n"
      		+ "feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\r\n"
      		+ "bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\r\n"
      		+ "word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I\r\n"
      		+ "hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\r\n"
      		+ "mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\r\n"
      		+ "and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\r\n"
      		+ "infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\r\n"
      		+ "so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\r\n"
      		+ "my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping\r\n"
      		+ "soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\r\n"

      		+ "looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to\r\n"
      		+ "notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might\r\n"
      		+ "have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have\r\n"
      		+ "pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\r\n"
      		+ "two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\r\n"
      		+ "was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\r\n"

      		+ "with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she\r\n"
      		+ "was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I\r\n"
      		+ "said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went\r\n"

      		+ "perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and\r\n"
      		+ "waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,\r\n"

      		+ "whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our\r\n"
      		+ "own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As\r\n"
      		+ "his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in\r\n"
      		+ "the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\r\n"
      		+ "beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\r\n"
      		+ "and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\r\n"

      		+ "to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\r\n"
      		+ "his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less\r\n"
      		+ "frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\r\n"
      		+ "inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\r\n"
      		+ "recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\r\n"
      		+ "quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to\r\n"
      		+ "hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight\r\n"
      		+ "over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\r\n"
      		+ "fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut\r\n"
      		+ "the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised\r\n"

      		+ "mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue\r\n"
      		+ "after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon\r\n"

      		+ "“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;\r\n"
      		+ "perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he\r\n"
      		+ "shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal\r\n"
      		+ "with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch\r\n"
      		+ "as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,\r\n"
      		+ "too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why\r\n"
      		+ "you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge\r\n"
      		+ "in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it\r\n"
      		+ "and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He\r\n"
      		+ "touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself\r\n"
      		+ "the same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall\r\n"
      		+ "unfold to you.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some\r\n"
      		+ "decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has\r\n"
      		+ "ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine\r\n"
      		+ "has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the\r\n"
      		+ "ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,\r\n"
      		+ "and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the\r\n"
      		+ "time comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply\r\n"
      		+ "he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as\r\n"
      		+ "he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell\r\n"
      		+ "you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the\r\n"
      		+ "good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\r\n"
      		+ "the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\r\n"
      		+ "the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,\r\n"
      		+ "and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\r\n"
      		+ "there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke\r\n"
      		+ "off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very\r\n"
      		+ "gravely:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\r\n"
      		+ "full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and\r\n"
      		+ "I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.\r\n"
      		+ "Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this\r\n"
      		+ "case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such\r\n"
      		+ "interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the\r\n"
      		+ "beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too\r\n"
      		+ "small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.\r\n"
      		+ "Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We\r\n"
      		+ "learn from failure, not from success!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I described Lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely\r\n"
      		+ "more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a\r\n"
      		+ "bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia\r\n"
      		+ "of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the\r\n"
      		+ "equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,\r\n"
      		+ "Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I\r\n"
      		+ "expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained\r\n"
      		+ "that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case\r\n"
      		+ "where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some\r\n"
      		+ "cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her\r\n"
      		+ "daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is\r\n"
      		+ "something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an\r\n"
      		+ "envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that\r\n"
      		+ "which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered\r\n"
      		+ "selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice\r\n"
      		+ "of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge of.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down\r\n"
      		+ "a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness\r\n"
      		+ "more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that\r\n"
      		+ "I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\r\n"
      		+ "shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\r\n"
      		+ "was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\r\n"
      		+ "red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\r\n"
      		+ "her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\r\n"
      		+ "hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\r\n"
      		+ "till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\r\n"
      		+ "seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\r\n"
      		+ "instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\r\n"
      		+ "the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\r\n"
      		+ "closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time\r\n"
      		+ "to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s\r\n"
      		+ "action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\r\n"
      		+ "it you or me?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\r\n"
      		+ "the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\r\n"
      		+ "door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\r\n"
      		+ "an eager whisper:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\r\n"
      		+ "have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\r\n"
      		+ "myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\r\n"
      		+ "sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had\r\n"
      		+ "been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\r\n"
      		+ "his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\r\n"
      		+ "him gravely as he held out his hand:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\r\n"
      		+ "bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he\r\n"
      		+ "suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to\r\n"
      		+ "help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\r\n"
      		+ "best help.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My\r\n"
      		+ "life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\r\n"
      		+ "her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\r\n"
      		+ "quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”\r\n"
      		+ "he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\r\n"
      		+ "me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\r\n"
      		+ "or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\r\n"
      		+ "what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\r\n"
      		+ "the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\r\n"
      		+ "the more young and strong than me”--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\r\n"
      		+ "it hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\r\n"
      		+ "old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\r\n"
      		+ "so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him\r\n"
      		+ "and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\r\n"
      		+ "understand----”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\r\n"
      		+ "that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\r\n"
      		+ "shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\r\n"
      		+ "must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\r\n"
      		+ "her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\r\n"
      		+ "asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\r\n"
      		+ "to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\r\n"
      		+ "them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\r\n"
      		+ "coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\r\n"
      		+ "child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made\r\n"
      		+ "the effort with success.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\r\n"
      		+ "the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\r\n"
      		+ "flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\r\n"
      		+ "its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\r\n"
      		+ "satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\r\n"
      		+ "coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\r\n"
      		+ "over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst\r\n"
      		+ "he bent over her.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing turning to me, said:\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\r\n"
      		+ "defibrinate it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\r\n"
      		+ "operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\r\n"
      		+ "back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy\r\n"
      		+ "of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\r\n"
      		+ "anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\r\n"
      		+ "was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must\r\n"
      		+ "have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\r\n"
      		+ "But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\r\n"
      		+ "his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\r\n"
      		+ "heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.\r\n"
      		+ "It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I\r\n"
      		+ "could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\r\n"
      		+ "arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\r\n"
      		+ "man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\r\n"
      		+ "presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\r\n"
      		+ "pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\r\n"
      		+ "which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\r\n"
      		+ "diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\r\n"
      		+ "and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\r\n"
      		+ "could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s\r\n"
      		+ "ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\r\n"
      		+ "me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\r\n"
      		+ "wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\r\n"
      		+ "much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\r\n"
      		+ "his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\r\n"
      		+ "that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\r\n"
      		+ "the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\r\n"
      		+ "can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\r\n"
      		+ "her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\r\n"
      		+ "have done. Good-bye.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\r\n"
      		+ "but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\r\n"

      		+ "“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded\r\n"
      		+ "to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\r\n"
      		+ "punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\r\n"
      		+ "disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\r\n"
      		+ "trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\r\n"
      		+ "was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\r\n"
      		+ "the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\r\n"

      		+ "and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\r\n"

      		+ "that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she\r\n"
      		+ "almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed\r\n"

      		+ "the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\r\n"
      		+ "gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\r\n"
      		+ "sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\r\n"
      		+ "and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\r\n"
      		+ "and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\r\n"
      		+ "did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--\r\n"

      		+ "“You do not want to go to sleep?”\r\n"

      		+ "“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\r\n"

      		+ "matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\r\n"

      		+ "came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\r\n"
      		+ "said to me gratefully:--\r\n"

      		+ "yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\r\n"
      		+ "do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\r\n"
      		+ "for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\r\n"
      		+ "drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\r\n"

      		+ "half-disgust:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\r\n"
      		+ "these flowers are only common garlic.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\r\n"
      		+ "iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\r\n"
      		+ "and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\r\n"
      		+ "others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\r\n"
      		+ "well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\r\n"
      		+ "me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\r\n"
      		+ "common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\r\n"
      		+ "wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\r\n"
      		+ "inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\r\n"
      		+ "and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\r\n"
      		+ "for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\r\n"
      		+ "help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\r\n"
      		+ "where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\r\n"
      		+ "I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s\r\n"
      		+ "actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\r\n"
      		+ "that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\r\n"
      		+ "securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\r\n"
      		+ "the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\r\n"
      		+ "in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\r\n"
      		+ "all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\r\n"
      		+ "the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\r\n"
      		+ "presently I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\r\n"
      		+ "this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\r\n"
      		+ "would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy was to wear round her neck.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\r\n"
      		+ "was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\r\n"
      		+ "neck. The last words he said to her were:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\r\n"
      		+ "not to-night open the window or the door.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all\r\n"

      		+ "friends?”\r\n"

      		+ "you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\r\n"
      		+ "more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\r\n"
      		+ "before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\r\n"
      		+ "have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\r\n"

      		+ "“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\r\n"
      		+ "asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\r\n"

      		+ "not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\r\n"
      		+ "horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\r\n"
      		+ "a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\r\n"
      		+ "too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\r\n"
      		+ "and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\r\n"
      		+ "pleased with her, I am sure.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\r\n"
      		+ "she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen\r\n"
      		+ "grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\r\n"
      		+ "was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\r\n"
      		+ "he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\r\n"

      		+ "forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\r\n"
      		+ "raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\r\n"
      		+ "his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\r\n"
      		+ "and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\r\n"
      		+ "that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\r\n"
      		+ "his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!\r\n"
      		+ "God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\r\n"
      		+ "we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\r\n"
      		+ "pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\r\n"
      		+ "mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\r\n"
      		+ "thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\r\n"
      		+ "must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\r\n"
      		+ "beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he\r\n"
      		+ "jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils\r\n"
      		+ "or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\r\n"
      		+ "all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\r\n"

      		+ "Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\r\n"
      		+ "This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\r\n"
      		+ "awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\r\n"
      		+ "infinite pity.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\r\n"
      		+ "meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\r\n"
      		+ "began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\r\n"
      		+ "operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\r\n"
      		+ "necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\r\n"
      		+ "warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.\r\n"
      		+ "You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\r\n"

      		+ "flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\r\n"
      		+ "was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\r\n"

      		+ "me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\r\n"
      		+ "their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\r\n"
      		+ "came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\r\n"
      		+ "over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\r\n"
      		+ "broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\r\n"
      		+ "dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\r\n"
      		+ "had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\r\n"
      		+ "to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\r\n"
      		+ "open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\r\n"
      		+ "in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\r\n"
      		+ "mother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\r\n"
      		+ "had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would\r\n"
      		+ "have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\r\n"

      		+ "My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\r\n"

      		+ "half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\r\n"
      		+ "and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\r\n"
      		+ "sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for\r\n"

      		+ "the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\r\n"

      		+ "_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\r\n"
      		+ "Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\r\n"
      		+ "and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\r\n"
      		+ "mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\r\n"
      		+ "finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\r\n"
      		+ "the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\r\n"
      		+ "hour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\r\n"
      		+ "more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\r\n"
      		+ "the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\r\n"
      		+ "desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\r\n"
      		+ "tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\r\n"
      		+ "late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\r\n"
      		+ "danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\r\n"
      		+ "and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\r\n"
      		+ "anywhere.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\r\n"
      		+ "locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\r\n"
      		+ "rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the\r\n"
      		+ "gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\r\n"
      		+ "When he saw me, he gasped out:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\r\n"
      		+ "not get my telegram?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\r\n"
      		+ "telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\r\n"
      		+ "and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\r\n"
      		+ "raised his hat as he said solemnly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual\r\n"
      		+ "recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get\r\n"
      		+ "in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\r\n"
      		+ "window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\r\n"
      		+ "handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\r\n"
      		+ "attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\r\n"
      		+ "with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\r\n"
      		+ "opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\r\n"
      		+ "was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at\r\n"
      		+ "hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\r\n"
      		+ "dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\r\n"
      		+ "servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\r\n"
      		+ "for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\r\n"
      		+ "room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\r\n"
      		+ "each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”\r\n"
      		+ "Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the\r\n"
      		+ "door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\r\n"
      		+ "faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\r\n"
      		+ "room.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\r\n"
      		+ "mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\r\n"
      		+ "sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\r\n"
      		+ "broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\r\n"
      		+ "fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\r\n"
      		+ "drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\r\n"
      		+ "mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\r\n"
      		+ "which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\r\n"
      		+ "Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\r\n"
      		+ "poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\r\n"
      		+ "listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\r\n"
      		+ "it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\r\n"
      		+ "on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\r\n"
      		+ "fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\r\n"
      		+ "but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\r\n"
      		+ "occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\r\n"
      		+ "hands. He said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\r\n"
      		+ "Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\r\n"
      		+ "get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\r\n"
      		+ "that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\r\n"
      		+ "more.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\r\n"
      		+ "women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\r\n"
      		+ "affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\r\n"
      		+ "sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\r\n"
      		+ "them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\r\n"
      		+ "them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\r\n"
      		+ "was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\r\n"
      		+ "Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\r\n"
      		+ "as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\r\n"
      		+ "boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\r\n"
      		+ "got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\r\n"
      		+ "we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\r\n"
      		+ "of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\r\n"
      		+ "she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\r\n"
      		+ "with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\r\n"
      		+ "must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\r\n"
      		+ "and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\r\n"
      		+ "earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\r\n"
      		+ "and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\r\n"
      		+ "understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\r\n"
      		+ "away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went\r\n"
      		+ "on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\r\n"
      		+ "be of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\r\n"
      		+ "stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s\r\n"
      		+ "face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\r\n"
      		+ "a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\r\n"
      		+ "her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\r\n"
      		+ "that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\r\n"
      		+ "still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\r\n"
      		+ "ever seen her.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\r\n"
      		+ "and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\r\n"
      		+ "out of the room.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the\r\n"
      		+ "stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\r\n"
      		+ "closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\r\n"
      		+ "the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\r\n"
      		+ "death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\r\n"
      		+ "observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\r\n"
      		+ "enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved\r\n"
      		+ "by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\r\n"
      		+ "something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\r\n"
      		+ "another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life\r\n"
      		+ "won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\r\n"
      		+ "exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\r\n"
      		+ "courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\r\n"
      		+ "veins for her?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\r\n"
      		+ "relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\r\n"
      		+ "glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and\r\n"
      		+ "rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I guess Art is the cause.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He handed me a telegram:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\r\n"
      		+ "Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\r\n"
      		+ "Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\r\n"
      		+ "me what to do.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\r\n"
      		+ "the eyes as he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\r\n"
      		+ "trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\r\n"
      		+ "us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\r\n"
      		+ "to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\r\n"
      		+ "told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\r\n"
      		+ "veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\r\n"
      		+ "occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\r\n"
      		+ "and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\r\n"
      		+ "good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\r\n"
      		+ "whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\r\n"
      		+ "to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\r\n"
      		+ "after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\r\n"
      		+ "breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\r\n"
      		+ "two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\r\n"
      		+ "thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\r\n"
      		+ "of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\r\n"
      		+ "He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when\r\n"
      		+ "we carried her to the bath.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\r\n"
      		+ "asked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\r\n"
      		+ "mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I\r\n"
      		+ "did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\r\n"
      		+ "paper, saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\r\n"
      		+ "and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\r\n"
      		+ "is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I\r\n"
      		+ "was all myself again.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\r\n"
      		+ "properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\r\n"
      		+ "to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\r\n"
      		+ "had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\r\n"
      		+ "know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\r\n"
      		+ "had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\r\n"
      		+ "fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\r\n"
      		+ "registrar and go on to the undertaker.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\r\n"
      		+ "sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\r\n"
      		+ "love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\r\n"
      		+ "man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\r\n"
      		+ "more for it! Now go.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\r\n"
      		+ "that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\r\n"
      		+ "going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\r\n"
      		+ "where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\r\n"
      		+ "ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\r\n"
      		+ "the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\r\n"
      		+ "the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\r\n"
      		+ "as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\r\n"
      		+ "sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\r\n"
      		+ "side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\r\n"
      		+ "expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\r\n"
      		+ "So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\r\n"
      		+ "the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\r\n"
      		+ "rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\r\n"
      		+ "to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no\r\n"
      		+ "right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\r\n"
      		+ "and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t\r\n"
      		+ "help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong\r\n"
      		+ "with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\r\n"
      		+ "that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\r\n"
      		+ "_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\r\n"
      		+ "Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\r\n"
      		+ "must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\r\n"
      		+ "no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\r\n"
      		+ "so?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\r\n"
      		+ "to-day. Is not that so?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That’s so.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\r\n"
      		+ "own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\r\n"
      		+ "since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\r\n"
      		+ "all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\r\n"
      		+ "her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\r\n"
      		+ "wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\r\n"
      		+ "bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\r\n"
      		+ "betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spoke\r\n"
      		+ "the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\r\n"
      		+ "regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\r\n"
      		+ "mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\r\n"
      		+ "heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\r\n"

      		+ "boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\r\n"

      		+ "knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\r\n"

      		+ "fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\r\n"
      		+ "were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\r\n"

      		+ "sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will\r\n"
      		+ "be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we\r\n"
      		+ "sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s\r\n"
      		+ "face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay\r\n"
      		+ "quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it\r\n"
      		+ "should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,\r\n"
      		+ "as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the\r\n"
      		+ "window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk\r\n"
      		+ "handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\r\n"
      		+ "the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\r\n"
      		+ "her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her\r\n"
      		+ "teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\r\n"
      		+ "had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the\r\n"
      		+ "canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,\r\n"
      		+ "and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort\r\n"
      		+ "of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,\r\n"
      		+ "and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,\r\n"
      		+ "and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\r\n"
      		+ "round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now\r\n"
      		+ "and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,\r\n"
      		+ "I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\r\n"
      		+ "flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\r\n"
      		+ "watching her.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.\r\n"
      		+ "She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with\r\n"
      		+ "her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto\r\n"
      		+ "so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she\r\n"
      		+ "became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was\r\n"
      		+ "certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\r\n"
      		+ "stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\r\n"
      		+ "waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any\r\n"
      		+ "mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\r\n"
      		+ "spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen\r\n"
      		+ "into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face\r\n"
      		+ "I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\r\n"
      		+ "sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down,\r\n"
      		+ "and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He\r\n"
      		+ "removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As\r\n"
      		+ "he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein\r\n"
      		+ "Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,\r\n"
      		+ "and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\r\n"
      		+ "at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark\r\n"
      		+ "me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and\r\n"
      		+ "let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but\r\n"
      		+ "when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\r\n"
      		+ "he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy\r\n"
      		+ "was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his\r\n"
      		+ "hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\r\n"
      		+ "perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\r\n"
      		+ "shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I\r\n"
      		+ "said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best\r\n"
      		+ "and easiest for her.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\r\n"
      		+ "his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\r\n"
      		+ "everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s\r\n"
      		+ "hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we\r\n"
      		+ "came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\r\n"
      		+ "softly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to\r\n"
      		+ "kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not\r\n"
      		+ "yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\r\n"
      		+ "with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then\r\n"
      		+ "gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her\r\n"
      		+ "breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\r\n"
      		+ "the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\r\n"
      		+ "gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a\r\n"
      		+ "sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\r\n"
      		+ "were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,\r\n"
      		+ "such as I had never heard from her lips:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent\r\n"
      		+ "eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\r\n"
      		+ "had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\r\n"
      		+ "the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\r\n"
      		+ "I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\r\n"
      		+ "across the room.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And\r\n"
      		+ "he stood between them like a lion at bay.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\r\n"
      		+ "or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\r\n"
      		+ "the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as\r\n"
      		+ "of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\r\n"
      		+ "together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\r\n"
      		+ "putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown\r\n"
      		+ "one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a\r\n"
      		+ "faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,\r\n"
      		+ "guard him, and give me peace!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\r\n"
      		+ "hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said\r\n"
      		+ "to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\r\n"
      		+ "forehead, and only once.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\r\n"
      		+ "ceased.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he\r\n"
      		+ "sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\r\n"
      		+ "nearly broke me down to see.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and\r\n"
      		+ "his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.\r\n"
      		+ "Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\r\n"
      		+ "recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\r\n"
      		+ "deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working\r\n"
      		+ "of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as\r\n"
      		+ "might be.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "    “We thought her dying whilst she slept,\r\n"
      		+ "        And sleeping when she died.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\r\n"
      		+ "her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\r\n"
      		+ "formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\r\n"
      		+ "afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\r\n"
      		+ "Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\r\n"
      		+ "me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\r\n"
      		+ "from the death-chamber:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to\r\n"
      		+ "attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our\r\n"
      		+ "establishment!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\r\n"
      		+ "the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\r\n"
      		+ "at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\r\n"
      		+ "father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\r\n"
      		+ "bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\r\n"
      		+ "ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s\r\n"
      		+ "papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\r\n"
      		+ "foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\r\n"
      		+ "so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\r\n"
      		+ "this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\r\n"
      		+ "coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\r\n"
      		+ "as this.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\r\n"
      		+ "in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\r\n"
      		+ "here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself\r\n"
      		+ "search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\r\n"
      		+ "the hands of strangers.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\r\n"
      		+ "the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to\r\n"
      		+ "him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions\r\n"
      		+ "regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\r\n"
      		+ "letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\r\n"
      		+ "saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\r\n"
      		+ "you.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\r\n"
      		+ "have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\r\n"
      		+ "diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\r\n"
      		+ "nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\r\n"
      		+ "his sanction, I shall use some.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\r\n"
      		+ "and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\r\n"
      		+ "for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\r\n"
      		+ "certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\r\n"
      		+ "_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\r\n"
      		+ "and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\r\n"
      		+ "winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\r\n"
      		+ "turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\r\n"
      		+ "wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s\r\n"
      		+ "loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\r\n"
      		+ "instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but\r\n"
      		+ "restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\r\n"
      		+ "that I was looking at a corpse.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\r\n"
      		+ "there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I\r\n"
      		+ "return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\r\n"
      		+ "from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\r\n"
      		+ "placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\r\n"
      		+ "took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\r\n"
      		+ "placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\r\n"
      		+ "came away.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\r\n"
      		+ "door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\r\n"
      		+ "knives.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\r\n"
      		+ "now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\r\n"
      		+ "her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\r\n"
      		+ "no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\r\n"
      		+ "the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\r\n"
      		+ "you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\r\n"
      		+ "operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,\r\n"
      		+ "and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\r\n"
      		+ "ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\r\n"
      		+ "unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\r\n"
      		+ "all, so that none know, save we alone.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\r\n"
      		+ "without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\r\n"
      		+ "to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\r\n"
      		+ "tenderness:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\r\n"
      		+ "because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\r\n"
      		+ "that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\r\n"
      		+ "shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\r\n"
      		+ "things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\r\n"
      		+ "did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but\r\n"
      		+ "man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you\r\n"
      		+ "send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay\r\n"
      		+ "horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\r\n"
      		+ "dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw\r\n"
      		+ "how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\r\n"
      		+ "weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not\r\n"
      		+ "hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many\r\n"
      		+ "years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\r\n"
      		+ "strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend\r\n"
      		+ "John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\r\n"
      		+ "not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\r\n"
      		+ "trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,\r\n"
      		+ "oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused a\r\n"
      		+ "moment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and\r\n"
      		+ "terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\r\n"
      		+ "a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,\r\n"
      		+ "and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without\r\n"
      		+ "moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\r\n"
      		+ "her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\r\n"
      		+ "lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\r\n"
      		+ "to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl\r\n"
      		+ "putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\r\n"
      		+ "alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\r\n"
      		+ "might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and\r\n"
      		+ "said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\r\n"
      		+ "impressed me.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. See!” Here he\r\n"
      		+ "held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\r\n"
      		+ "woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely\r\n"
      		+ "come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus\r\n"
      		+ "unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\r\n"
      		+ "new puzzle to grapple with.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial\r\n"
      		+ "and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\r\n"
      		+ "cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for\r\n"
      		+ "some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\r\n"
      		+ "in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\r\n"
      		+ "entailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct\r\n"
      		+ "issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\r\n"
      		+ "real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had\r\n"
      		+ "told us so much he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\r\n"
      		+ "pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\r\n"
      		+ "penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\r\n"
      		+ "alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\r\n"
      		+ "collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out\r\n"
      		+ "her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were\r\n"
      		+ "right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should\r\n"
      		+ "have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.\r\n"
      		+ "Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\r\n"
      		+ "disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\r\n"
      		+ "wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come\r\n"
      		+ "into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her\r\n"
      		+ "mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\r\n"
      		+ "will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been\r\n"
      		+ "treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,\r\n"
      		+ "though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the\r\n"
      		+ "inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just\r\n"
      		+ "rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure\r\n"
      		+ "you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\r\n"
      		+ "he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an\r\n"
      		+ "object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\r\n"
      		+ "see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to\r\n"
      		+ "us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\r\n"
      		+ "criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock, so\r\n"
      		+ "a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in\r\n"
      		+ "very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,\r\n"
      		+ "true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and\r\n"
      		+ "there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at\r\n"
      		+ "once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\r\n"
      		+ "explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\r\n"
      		+ "less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_\r\n"
      		+ "quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and\r\n"
      		+ "exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\r\n"
      		+ "the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\r\n"
      		+ "as we could avoid were saved.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\r\n"
      		+ "manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\r\n"
      		+ "much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\r\n"
      		+ "attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\r\n"
      		+ "bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\r\n"
      		+ "was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\r\n"
      		+ "constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\r\n"
      		+ "bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I\r\n"
      		+ "felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and\r\n"
      		+ "led me in, saying huskily:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\r\n"
      		+ "no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to\r\n"
      		+ "thank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\r\n"
      		+ "laid his head on my breast, crying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me\r\n"
      		+ "all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much\r\n"
      		+ "expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\r\n"
      		+ "shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s\r\n"
      		+ "heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\r\n"
      		+ "softly to him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come and look at her.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.\r\n"
      		+ "God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\r\n"
      		+ "loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\r\n"
      		+ "fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At\r\n"
      		+ "last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Jack, is she really dead?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\r\n"
      		+ "that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than\r\n"
      		+ "I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\r\n"
      		+ "softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\r\n"
      		+ "especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\r\n"
      		+ "suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\r\n"
      		+ "kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\r\n"
      		+ "long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\r\n"
      		+ "coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his\r\n"
      		+ "and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,\r\n"
      		+ "fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\r\n"
      		+ "good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men\r\n"
      		+ "to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he\r\n"
      		+ "came out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he\r\n"
      		+ "replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\r\n"
      		+ "the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but\r\n"
      		+ "when we had lit our cigars he said--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Lord----”; but Arthur interrupted him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:\r\n"
      		+ "I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\r\n"
      		+ "recent.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Professor answered very sweetly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you\r\n"
      		+ "‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title of\r\n"
      		+ "a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\r\n"
      		+ "your goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I know\r\n"
      		+ "that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\r\n"
      		+ "rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He answered with a grave kindness:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\r\n"
      		+ "violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\r\n"
      		+ "cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be\r\n"
      		+ "more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\r\n"
      		+ "not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust\r\n"
      		+ "shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\r\n"
      		+ "though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from\r\n"
      		+ "first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her\r\n"
      		+ "dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways\r\n"
      		+ "trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\r\n"
      		+ "Jack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\r\n"
      		+ "speak, and finally said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“May I ask you something now?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Certainly.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I\r\n"
      		+ "want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers and\r\n"
      		+ "letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,\r\n"
      		+ "be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them\r\n"
      		+ "before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch\r\n"
      		+ "them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep\r\n"
      		+ "them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them\r\n"
      		+ "safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back\r\n"
      		+ "to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy’s sake?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I\r\n"
      		+ "am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you\r\n"
      		+ "with questions till the time comes.”\r\n"

      		+ "The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--\r\n"

      		+ "“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be\r\n"
      		+ "all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of\r\n"
      		+ "all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we\r\n"
      		+ "reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our\r\n"
      		+ "duty, and all will be well!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to\r\n"

      		+ "the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I\r\n"

      		+ "mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive\r\n"
      		+ "nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the\r\n"
      		+ "mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost\r\n"
      		+ "straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;\r\n"
      		+ "such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,\r\n"
      		+ "but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set\r\n"
      		+ "widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. He\r\n"
      		+ "said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "good, but I had yet to learn----” He finished his speech with a courtly\r\n"

      		+ "once began:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin\r\n"
      		+ "to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were\r\n"
      		+ "with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look\r\n"
      		+ "surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in\r\n"
      		+ "imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain\r\n"
      		+ "things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In\r\n"
      		+ "great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much\r\n"
      		+ "kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always\r\n"
      		+ "so with young ladies.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you\r\n"
      		+ "if you like.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I\r\n"
      		+ "could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is\r\n"
      		+ "some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our\r\n"
      		+ "mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful\r\n"
      		+ "bow, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“May I read it?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for\r\n"
      		+ "an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a\r\n"
      		+ "man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.\r\n"
      		+ "And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?\r\n"
      		+ "Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over,\r\n"
      		+ "and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my\r\n"
      		+ "workbasket and handed it to him.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking that\r\n"
      		+ "it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not\r\n"
      		+ "have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must\r\n"
      		+ "be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may\r\n"
      		+ "I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you\r\n"
      		+ "can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself in a\r\n"
      		+ "chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,\r\n"
      		+ "whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be\r\n"
      		+ "disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down\r\n"
      		+ "the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and\r\n"
      		+ "took me by both hands.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper\r\n"
      		+ "is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so\r\n"
      		+ "much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that\r\n"
      		+ "you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so\r\n"
      		+ "clever woman. Madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever Abraham Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.\r\n"
      		+ "It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a\r\n"
      		+ "friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you\r\n"
      		+ "and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;\r\n"
      		+ "you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and\r\n"
      		+ "your husband will be blessed in you.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and\r\n"
      		+ "women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to\r\n"
      		+ "him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you\r\n"
      		+ "have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every\r\n"
      		+ "line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your\r\n"
      		+ "marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell\r\n"
      		+ "all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that\r\n"
      		+ "angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of\r\n"
      		+ "angels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for\r\n"
      		+ "you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your\r\n"
      		+ "husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and\r\n"
      		+ "is he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan, so I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’s\r\n"
      		+ "death.” He interrupted:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I went\r\n"
      		+ "on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he\r\n"
      		+ "had a sort of shock.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of\r\n"
      		+ "a shock was it?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\r\n"
      		+ "which led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he\r\n"
      		+ "experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\r\n"
      		+ "has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I\r\n"
      		+ "was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to\r\n"
      		+ "him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands\r\n"
      		+ "and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my\r\n"
      		+ "hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not\r\n"
      		+ "had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by\r\n"
      		+ "my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such\r\n"
      		+ "nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing\r\n"
      		+ "years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here\r\n"
      		+ "full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I\r\n"
      		+ "am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life\r\n"
      		+ "happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for\r\n"
      		+ "the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some\r\n"
      		+ "use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my\r\n"
      		+ "study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him\r\n"
      		+ "that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy\r\n"
      		+ "one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.\r\n"
      		+ "Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not\r\n"
      		+ "where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat\r\n"
      		+ "and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not\r\n"
      		+ "speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I\r\n"
      		+ "want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I\r\n"
      		+ "will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of\r\n"
      		+ "husband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat\r\n"
      		+ "now; afterwards you shall tell me all.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great\r\n"
      		+ "learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go\r\n"
      		+ "on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I\r\n"
      		+ "trusted him, so I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not\r\n"
      		+ "laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of\r\n"
      		+ "fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I\r\n"
      		+ "have even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by\r\n"
      		+ "his manner as well as his words when he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which\r\n"
      		+ "I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little\r\n"
      		+ "of any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep\r\n"
      		+ "an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close\r\n"
      		+ "it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that\r\n"
      		+ "make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my\r\n"
      		+ "mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,\r\n"
      		+ "but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that\r\n"
      		+ "happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and\r\n"
      		+ "judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell\r\n"
      		+ "me what you think.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, and\r\n"
      		+ "somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” he\r\n"
      		+ "said. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my\r\n"
      		+ "friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell\r\n"
      		+ "you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all\r\n"

      		+ "“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,\r\n"
      		+ "for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not\r\n"
      		+ "expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract\r\n"
      		+ "truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always\r\n"
      		+ "believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "    “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock\r\n"
      		+ "to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;\r\n"
      		+ "at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet\r\n"
      		+ "very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,\r\n"
      		+ "I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child\r\n"
      		+ "in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers\r\n"
      		+ "say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\r\n"
      		+ "in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he\r\n"
      		+ "will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\r\n"
      		+ "wish to learn. And then----”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we\r\n"
      		+ "spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is\r\n"
      		+ "the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful\r\n"
      		+ "ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what\r\n"
      		+ "heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\r\n"
      		+ "passing....\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\r\n"
      		+ "altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\r\n"
      		+ "throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the\r\n"
      		+ "similarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,\r\n"
      		+ "and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he\r\n"
      		+ "attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some\r\n"
      		+ "animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think\r\n"
      		+ "that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern\r\n"
      		+ "heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may\r\n"
      		+ "be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some\r\n"
      		+ "sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from\r\n"
      		+ "the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred\r\n"
      		+ "there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago\r\n"
      		+ "a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a\r\n"
      		+ "week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the\r\n"
      		+ "Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare\r\n"
      		+ "came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even\r\n"
      		+ "this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he\r\n"
      		+ "might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted\r\n"
      		+ "to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child home\r\n"
      		+ "you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies\r\n"
      		+ "to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another\r\n"
      		+ "night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will\r\n"
      		+ "not let it away for some days?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not\r\n"
      		+ "healed.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and\r\n"
      		+ "the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it\r\n"
      		+ "was, he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek\r\n"
      		+ "somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of\r\n"
      		+ "bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we\r\n"
      		+ "started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\r\n"
      		+ "made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\r\n"
      		+ "radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he\r\n"
      		+ "went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to\r\n"
      		+ "locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at\r\n"
      		+ "last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse\r\n"
      		+ "police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of\r\n"
      		+ "the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for\r\n"
      		+ "it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found\r\n"
      		+ "the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,\r\n"
      		+ "and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to\r\n"
      		+ "precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the\r\n"
      		+ "courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My\r\n"
      		+ "companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\r\n"
      		+ "carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,\r\n"
      		+ "one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he\r\n"
      		+ "fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,\r\n"
      		+ "proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed\r\n"
      		+ "with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some\r\n"
      		+ "days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\r\n"
      		+ "turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\r\n"
      		+ "beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\r\n"
      		+ "stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\r\n"
      		+ "brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\r\n"
      		+ "candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\r\n"
      		+ "imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\r\n"
      		+ "not the only thing which could pass away.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so\r\n"
      		+ "that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\r\n"
      		+ "dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\r\n"
      		+ "made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took\r\n"
      		+ "out a turnscrew.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What are you going to do?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began\r\n"
      		+ "taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\r\n"
      		+ "casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\r\n"
      		+ "stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\r\n"
      		+ "hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again\r\n"
      		+ "fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew\r\n"
      		+ "through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\r\n"
      		+ "made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of\r\n"
      		+ "the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We\r\n"
      		+ "doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\r\n"
      		+ "such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never\r\n"
      		+ "stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of\r\n"
      		+ "the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the\r\n"
      		+ "edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\r\n"
      		+ "coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\r\n"
      		+ "look.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\r\n"
      		+ "and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied now, friend\r\n"
      		+ "John?” he asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\r\n"
      		+ "I answered him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only\r\n"
      		+ "proves one thing.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And what is that, friend John?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That it is not there.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you--how\r\n"
      		+ "can you--account for it not being there?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s people\r\n"
      		+ "may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\r\n"
      		+ "the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah\r\n"
      		+ "well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\r\n"
      		+ "them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\r\n"
      		+ "bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and\r\n"
      		+ "locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had\r\n"
      		+ "better be assured.” I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\r\n"
      		+ "bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;\r\n"
      		+ "“there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\r\n"
      		+ "of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he\r\n"
      		+ "told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at\r\n"
      		+ "the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\r\n"
      		+ "figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\r\n"
      		+ "sight.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\r\n"
      		+ "clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and\r\n"
      		+ "unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\r\n"
      		+ "and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\r\n"
      		+ "observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had\r\n"
      		+ "a dreary, miserable time.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\r\n"
      		+ "streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\r\n"
      		+ "farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I\r\n"
      		+ "too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I\r\n"
      		+ "stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an\r\n"
      		+ "early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\r\n"
      		+ "juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\r\n"
      		+ "figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden\r\n"
      		+ "by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the\r\n"
      		+ "rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\r\n"
      		+ "coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When\r\n"
      		+ "he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Are you satisfied now?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do you not see the child?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I\r\n"
      		+ "asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\r\n"
      		+ "out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\r\n"
      		+ "trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was\r\n"
      		+ "without a scratch or scar of any kind.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\r\n"
      		+ "about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\r\n"
      		+ "give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\r\n"
      		+ "have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.\r\n"
      		+ "So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\r\n"
      		+ "heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\r\n"
      		+ "it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out\r\n"
      		+ "well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy\r\n"
      		+ "tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until\r\n"
      		+ "he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation\r\n"
      		+ "of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a\r\n"
      		+ "cab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours’\r\n"
      		+ "sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall\r\n"
      		+ "go with him on another expedition.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "_27 September._--It was two o’clock before we found a suitable\r\n"
      		+ "opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,\r\n"
      		+ "and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\r\n"
      		+ "away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw\r\n"
      		+ "the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till\r\n"
      		+ "morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not\r\n"
      		+ "want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the\r\n"
      		+ "reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of\r\n"
      		+ "place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were\r\n"
      		+ "incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.\r\n"
      		+ "Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead\r\n"
      		+ "nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to\r\n"
      		+ "open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\r\n"
      		+ "eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,\r\n"
      		+ "and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\r\n"
      		+ "no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again\r\n"
      		+ "courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as\r\n"
      		+ "last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\r\n"
      		+ "streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.\r\n"
      		+ "He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\r\n"
      		+ "of surprise and dismay shot through me.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\r\n"
      		+ "funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\r\n"
      		+ "could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than\r\n"
      		+ "before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Is this a juggle?” I said to him.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\r\n"
      		+ "he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\r\n"
      		+ "dead lips and showed the white teeth.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this\r\n"
      		+ "and this”--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\r\n"
      		+ "it--“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend\r\n"
      		+ "John?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not\r\n"
      		+ "accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\r\n"
      		+ "argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“She may have been placed here since last night.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I do not know. Some one has done it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not\r\n"
      		+ "look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not\r\n"
      		+ "seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\r\n"
      		+ "triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\r\n"
      		+ "the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\r\n"
      		+ "examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is\r\n"
      		+ "some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire\r\n"
      		+ "when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\r\n"
      		+ "that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\r\n"
      		+ "he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she\r\n"
      		+ "is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when\r\n"
      		+ "the Un-Dead sleep at home”--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\r\n"
      		+ "his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”--“their face show what\r\n"
      		+ "they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\r\n"
      		+ "the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so\r\n"
      		+ "it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood\r\n"
      		+ "cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s\r\n"
      		+ "theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\r\n"
      		+ "idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\r\n"
      		+ "my face, for he said almost joyously:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, you believe now?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to\r\n"
      		+ "accept. How will you do this bloody work?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\r\n"
      		+ "drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so\r\n"
      		+ "mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling\r\n"
      		+ "was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to\r\n"
      		+ "shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\r\n"
      		+ "called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,\r\n"
      		+ "or all objective?\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\r\n"
      		+ "if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\r\n"
      		+ "snap, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I\r\n"
      		+ "did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is\r\n"
      		+ "to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are\r\n"
      		+ "thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is\r\n"
      		+ "simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\r\n"
      		+ "now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to\r\n"
      		+ "want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the\r\n"
      		+ "wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at\r\n"
      		+ "the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\r\n"
      		+ "to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\r\n"
      		+ "beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know\r\n"
      		+ "of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\r\n"
      		+ "and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I\r\n"
      		+ "took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me\r\n"
      		+ "because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\r\n"
      		+ "good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\r\n"
      		+ "this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\r\n"
      		+ "killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\r\n"
      		+ "have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet\r\n"
      		+ "he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will\r\n"
      		+ "sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\r\n"
      		+ "his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he\r\n"
      		+ "will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\r\n"
      		+ "an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since\r\n"
      		+ "I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\r\n"
      		+ "must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,\r\n"
      		+ "must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\r\n"
      		+ "him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is\r\n"
      		+ "made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see\r\n"
      		+ "that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\r\n"

      		+ "may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall\r\n"
      		+ "hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\r\n"
      		+ "you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of\r\n"
      		+ "pity:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of\r\n"
      		+ "acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\r\n"
      		+ "my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if\r\n"
      		+ "the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from\r\n"
      		+ "you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can\r\n"
      		+ "to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so\r\n"
      		+ "much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land\r\n"
      		+ "to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and\r\n"
      		+ "then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I\r\n"
      		+ "am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you\r\n"
      		+ "gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her\r\n"
      		+ "lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights\r\n"
      		+ "and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good\r\n"
      		+ "even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.” He\r\n"
      		+ "said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected\r\n"
      		+ "by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\r\n"
      		+ "shall go with you and wait.”\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the\r\n"
      		+ "churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams\r\n"
      		+ "of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across\r\n"
      		+ "the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly\r\n"
      		+ "in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked\r\n"
      		+ "well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so\r\n"
      		+ "sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it\r\n"
      		+ "that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant\r\n"
      		+ "to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural\r\n"
      		+ "hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by\r\n"
      		+ "entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.\r\n"
      		+ "He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped\r\n"
      		+ "forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\r\n"
      		+ "coffin?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” He\r\n"
      		+ "took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur\r\n"
      		+ "looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\r\n"
      		+ "forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\r\n"
      		+ "at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,\r\n"
      		+ "the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\r\n"
      		+ "again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\r\n"
      		+ "recoiled.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The coffin was empty!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by\r\n"
      		+ "Quincey Morris:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t ask\r\n"
      		+ "such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a\r\n"
      		+ "doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.\r\n"
      		+ "Is this your doing?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\r\n"
      		+ "touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\r\n"
      		+ "I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which\r\n"
      		+ "was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and\r\n"
      		+ "saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in\r\n"
      		+ "day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yes.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,\r\n"
      		+ "and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came\r\n"
      		+ "here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here\r\n"
      		+ "all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable\r\n"
      		+ "that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\r\n"
      		+ "which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last\r\n"
      		+ "night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my\r\n"
      		+ "garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But\r\n"
      		+ "bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me\r\n"
      		+ "outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.\r\n"
      		+ "So”--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”\r\n"
      		+ "He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\r\n"
      		+ "door behind him.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\r\n"
      		+ "that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing\r\n"
      		+ "gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\r\n"
      		+ "passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was\r\n"
      		+ "to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how\r\n"
      		+ "humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to\r\n"
      		+ "hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each\r\n"
      		+ "in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I\r\n"
      		+ "could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the\r\n"
      		+ "mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to\r\n"
      		+ "throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey\r\n"
      		+ "Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\r\n"
      		+ "accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to\r\n"
      		+ "stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of\r\n"
      		+ "tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\r\n"
      		+ "definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\r\n"
      		+ "thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\r\n"
      		+ "napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\r\n"
      		+ "dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\r\n"
      		+ "mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin\r\n"
      		+ "strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\r\n"
      		+ "setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\r\n"
      		+ "asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near\r\n"
      		+ "also, as they too were curious. He answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.\r\n"
      		+ "“Great Scott! Is this a game?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was an\r\n"
      		+ "answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\r\n"
      		+ "that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a\r\n"
      		+ "purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was\r\n"
      		+ "impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places\r\n"
      		+ "assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\r\n"
      		+ "one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself\r\n"
      		+ "been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,\r\n"
      		+ "who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\r\n"
      		+ "within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or\r\n"
      		+ "yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree\r\n"
      		+ "or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\r\n"
      		+ "mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\r\n"
      		+ "woeful presage through the night.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews\r\n"
      		+ "we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something\r\n"
      		+ "dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of\r\n"
      		+ "moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling\r\n"
      		+ "prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.\r\n"
      		+ "We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a\r\n"
      		+ "fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a\r\n"
      		+ "child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We\r\n"
      		+ "were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning hand, seen by us as\r\n"
      		+ "he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the\r\n"
      		+ "white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see\r\n"
      		+ "clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,\r\n"
      		+ "and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was\r\n"
      		+ "turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\r\n"
      		+ "wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\r\n"
      		+ "all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the\r\n"
      		+ "tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\r\n"
      		+ "concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lips\r\n"
      		+ "were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\r\n"
      		+ "chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had\r\n"
      		+ "not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\r\n"
      		+ "shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\r\n"
      		+ "when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form\r\n"
      		+ "and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\r\n"
      		+ "the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love\r\n"
      		+ "passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\r\n"
      		+ "done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\r\n"
      		+ "light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,\r\n"
      		+ "how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to\r\n"
      		+ "the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\r\n"
      		+ "clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\r\n"
      		+ "over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There\r\n"
      		+ "was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\r\n"
      		+ "she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell\r\n"
      		+ "back and hid his face in his hands.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\r\n"
      		+ "said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are\r\n"
      		+ "hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\r\n"
      		+ "tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\r\n"
      		+ "who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under\r\n"
      		+ "a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She\r\n"
      		+ "was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\r\n"
      		+ "them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a\r\n"
      		+ "suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\r\n"
      		+ "the tomb.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\r\n"
      		+ "arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was\r\n"
      		+ "shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no\r\n"
      		+ "quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled\r\n"
      		+ "malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\r\n"
      		+ "mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw\r\n"
      		+ "out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of\r\n"
      		+ "the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,\r\n"
      		+ "blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\r\n"
      		+ "the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could\r\n"
      		+ "kill--we saw it at that moment.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\r\n"
      		+ "between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\r\n"
      		+ "entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\r\n"
      		+ "answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like\r\n"
      		+ "this ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I\r\n"
      		+ "simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the\r\n"
      		+ "click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close\r\n"
      		+ "to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred\r\n"
      		+ "emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified\r\n"
      		+ "amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\r\n"
      		+ "body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\r\n"
      		+ "where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of\r\n"
      		+ "relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\r\n"
      		+ "to the edges of the door.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When this was done, he lifted the child and said:\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a\r\n"
      		+ "funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The\r\n"
      		+ "friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\r\n"
      		+ "the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of\r\n"
      		+ "to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\r\n"
      		+ "night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find\r\n"
      		+ "him, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur,\r\n"
      		+ "he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look\r\n"
      		+ "back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter\r\n"
      		+ "waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have\r\n"
      		+ "passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\r\n"
      		+ "overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\r\n"
      		+ "on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\r\n"
      		+ "slept with more or less reality of sleep.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o’clock we three--Arthur,\r\n"
      		+ "Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to\r\n"
      		+ "notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of\r\n"
      		+ "course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\r\n"
      		+ "us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\r\n"
      		+ "strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\r\n"
      		+ "gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief\r\n"
      		+ "that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\r\n"
      		+ "ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\r\n"
      		+ "long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\r\n"
      		+ "fair weight.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\r\n"
      		+ "the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it\r\n"
      		+ "behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also\r\n"
      		+ "two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own\r\n"
      		+ "ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work\r\n"
      		+ "by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all looked--Arthur\r\n"
      		+ "trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its\r\n"
      		+ "death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but\r\n"
      		+ "loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without her\r\n"
      		+ "soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked. Presently\r\n"
      		+ "he said to Van Helsing:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her\r\n"
      		+ "as she was, and is.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,\r\n"
      		+ "the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to\r\n"
      		+ "see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a\r\n"
      		+ "devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual\r\n"
      		+ "methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\r\n"
      		+ "placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some\r\n"
      		+ "plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\r\n"
      		+ "a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue\r\n"
      		+ "flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a\r\n"
      		+ "round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about\r\n"
      		+ "three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and\r\n"
      		+ "was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\r\n"
      		+ "as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To\r\n"
      		+ "me, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\r\n"
      		+ "bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\r\n"
      		+ "to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their\r\n"
      		+ "courage, and remained silent and quiet.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\r\n"
      		+ "experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\r\n"
      		+ "of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the\r\n"
      		+ "curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age\r\n"
      		+ "adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that\r\n"
      		+ "die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey\r\n"
      		+ "on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the\r\n"
      		+ "ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met\r\n"
      		+ "that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night\r\n"
      		+ "when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,\r\n"
      		+ "have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would\r\n"
      		+ "all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.\r\n"
      		+ "The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those\r\n"
      		+ "children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if\r\n"
      		+ "she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her\r\n"
      		+ "power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that\r\n"
      		+ "so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny\r\n"
      		+ "wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays\r\n"
      		+ "unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when\r\n"
      		+ "this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor\r\n"
      		+ "lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by\r\n"
      		+ "night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she\r\n"
      		+ "shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will\r\n"
      		+ "be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.\r\n"
      		+ "To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\r\n"
      		+ "right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\r\n"
      		+ "night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\r\n"
      		+ "was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\r\n"
      		+ "herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ Tell me if there be\r\n"
      		+ "such a one amongst us?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\r\n"
      		+ "kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\r\n"
      		+ "Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\r\n"
      		+ "said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\r\n"
      		+ "snow:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me\r\n"
      		+ "what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his\r\n"
      		+ "shoulder, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be\r\n"
      		+ "driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\r\n"
      		+ "that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\r\n"
      		+ "than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\r\n"
      		+ "you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only\r\n"
      		+ "think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\r\n"
      		+ "you all the time.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\r\n"
      		+ "heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for\r\n"
      		+ "the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\r\n"
      		+ "follow--strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that\r\n"
      		+ "we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\r\n"
      		+ "action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened\r\n"
      		+ "his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\r\n"
      		+ "could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\r\n"
      		+ "see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\r\n"
      		+ "came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted\r\n"
      		+ "in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\r\n"
      		+ "lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur\r\n"
      		+ "never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\r\n"
      		+ "rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\r\n"
      		+ "the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His\r\n"
      		+ "face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\r\n"
      		+ "gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\r\n"
      		+ "vault.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\r\n"
      		+ "teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The\r\n"
      		+ "terrible task was over.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had\r\n"
      		+ "we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,\r\n"
      		+ "and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain\r\n"
      		+ "on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\r\n"
      		+ "considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few\r\n"
      		+ "minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\r\n"
      		+ "coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\r\n"
      		+ "to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\r\n"
      		+ "been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\r\n"
      		+ "strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\r\n"
      		+ "horror that lay upon it.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\r\n"
      		+ "and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\r\n"
      		+ "privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\r\n"
      		+ "her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that\r\n"
      		+ "there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\r\n"
      		+ "pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\r\n"
      		+ "to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\r\n"
      		+ "sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\r\n"
      		+ "symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to\r\n"
      		+ "him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand\r\n"
      		+ "in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\r\n"
      		+ "and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and laying\r\n"
      		+ "his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\r\n"
      		+ "unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\r\n"
      		+ "she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning\r\n"
      		+ "devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is\r\n"
      		+ "the devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul is with Him!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\r\n"
      		+ "tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\r\n"
      		+ "of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\r\n"
      		+ "garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,\r\n"
      		+ "and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked\r\n"
      		+ "the door he gave the key to Arthur.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\r\n"
      		+ "seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was\r\n"
      		+ "gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\r\n"
      		+ "on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\r\n"
      		+ "to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\r\n"
      		+ "of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can\r\n"
      		+ "follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in\r\n"
      		+ "it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all\r\n"
      		+ "of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do\r\n"
      		+ "we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor as we moved off:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of\r\n"
      		+ "the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you\r\n"
      		+ "know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans\r\n"
      		+ "unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult\r\n"
      		+ "about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall\r\n"
      		+ "return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I\r\n"
      		+ "shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.\r\n"
      		+ "Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a\r\n"
      		+ "terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we\r\n"

      		+ "The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,\r\n"
      		+ "“pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your\r\n"

      		+ "When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of\r\n"
      		+ "a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten\r\n"
      		+ "copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” he\r\n"
      		+ "said, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of\r\n"
      		+ "all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep\r\n"
      		+ "them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your\r\n"
      		+ "faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What\r\n"

      		+ "any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have\r\n"
      		+ "kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we\r\n"
      		+ "shall go through all these together when we meet.” He then made ready\r\n"
      		+ "for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I\r\n"

      		+ "guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,\r\n"
      		+ "after a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held out\r\n"

      		+ "The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it\r\n"
      		+ "was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a\r\n"

      		+ "I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have\r\n"

      		+ "“I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\r\n"

      		+ "to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\r\n"
      		+ "vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\r\n"
      		+ "his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat\r\n"
      		+ "down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite\r\n"
      		+ "pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\r\n"
      		+ "apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for\r\n"
      		+ "days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been\r\n"
      		+ "unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\r\n"
      		+ "sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\r\n"
      		+ "whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was\r\n"
      		+ "surrounded, he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said,\r\n"
      		+ "as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet--and none other can\r\n"
      		+ "ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall\r\n"
      		+ "know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful\r\n"
      		+ "now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be\r\n"
      		+ "like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy’s sake?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your\r\n"
      		+ "own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth\r\n"
      		+ "the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring\r\n"
      		+ "to you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will not call\r\n"
      		+ "in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\r\n"
      		+ "sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\r\n"
      		+ "will let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\r\n"
      		+ "I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\r\n"
      		+ "He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then noticing\r\n"
      		+ "my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor\r\n"
      		+ "old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in\r\n"
      		+ "trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the\r\n"
      		+ "manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\r\n"
      		+ "how much I knew; so I said to him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me\r\n"
      		+ "be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You\r\n"
      		+ "will know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and\r\n"
      		+ "stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed\r\n"
      		+ "but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\r\n"
      		+ "bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\r\n"
      		+ "momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\r\n"
      		+ "as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.\r\n"

      		+ "_30 September._--I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming\r\n"
      		+ "and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript\r\n"
      		+ "of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife\r\n"
      		+ "had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the\r\n"
      		+ "carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave\r\n"
      		+ "us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I\r\n"
      		+ "have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had\r\n"
      		+ "finished, Mrs. Harker said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary\r\n"
      		+ "interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I\r\n"
      		+ "could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so\r\n"
      		+ "I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a\r\n"
      		+ "lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I\r\n"
      		+ "answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but\r\n"
      		+ "just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was\r\n"
      		+ "peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\r\n"
      		+ "before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was\r\n"
      		+ "jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting\r\n"
      		+ "task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the\r\n"
      		+ "edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\r\n"
      		+ "he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might\r\n"
      		+ "have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\r\n"
      		+ "before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I\r\n"
      		+ "could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She\r\n"
      		+ "came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\r\n"
      		+ "the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\r\n"
      		+ "people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and\r\n"
      		+ "held out her hand.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.\r\n"
      		+ "Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all\r\n"
      		+ "over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one\r\n"
      		+ "of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he\r\n"
      		+ "said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,\r\n"
      		+ "you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever\r\n"
      		+ "saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then what are you doing here?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then don’t stay.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be\r\n"
      		+ "pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply\r\n"
      		+ "contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What an asinine question!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once\r\n"
      		+ "championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as\r\n"
      		+ "he had shown contempt to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so\r\n"
      		+ "loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of\r\n"
      		+ "interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his\r\n"
      		+ "household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of\r\n"
      		+ "them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and\r\n"
      		+ "effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I\r\n"
      		+ "cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates\r\n"
      		+ "lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” I\r\n"
      		+ "positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet\r\n"
      		+ "lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met\r\n"
      		+ "with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\r\n"
      		+ "gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched\r\n"
      		+ "some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any\r\n"
      		+ "way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or\r\n"
      		+ "power.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\r\n"
      		+ "quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\r\n"
      		+ "began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for\r\n"
      		+ "he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\r\n"
      		+ "completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\r\n"
      		+ "certain things.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,\r\n"
      		+ "it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being\r\n"
      		+ "put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and\r\n"
      		+ "perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\r\n"
      		+ "matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\r\n"
      		+ "life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\r\n"
      		+ "take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I\r\n"
      		+ "tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by\r\n"
      		+ "the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his\r\n"
      		+ "blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is\r\n"
      		+ "the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\r\n"
      		+ "vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t that true,\r\n"
      		+ "doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to\r\n"
      		+ "either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up\r\n"
      		+ "his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I\r\n"
      		+ "saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying\r\n"
      		+ "pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\r\n"
      		+ "under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he\r\n"
      		+ "replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.\r\n"
      		+ "May He bless and keep you!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\r\n"
      		+ "me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took\r\n"
      		+ "ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for\r\n"
      		+ "many a long day.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\r\n"
      		+ "boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come\r\n"
      		+ "here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have\r\n"
      		+ "much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And\r\n"
      		+ "Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own\r\n"
      		+ "diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; at\r\n"
      		+ "which the Professor interrupted me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain--a brain that a man\r\n"
      		+ "should have were he much gifted--and a woman’s heart. The good God\r\n"
      		+ "fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\r\n"
      		+ "combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\r\n"
      		+ "to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\r\n"
      		+ "affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are\r\n"
      		+ "determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is\r\n"
      		+ "no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her\r\n"
      		+ "in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in\r\n"
      		+ "waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,\r\n"
      		+ "she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to\r\n"
      		+ "think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she\r\n"
      		+ "must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and\r\n"
      		+ "we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we\r\n"
      		+ "had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\r\n"
      		+ "the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then we\r\n"
      		+ "might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk\r\n"
      		+ "that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not think\r\n"
      		+ "of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silence that\r\n"
      		+ "lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for\r\n"
      		+ "dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\r\n"
      		+ "put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to\r\n"
      		+ "this morning.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the\r\n"
      		+ "little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\r\n"
      		+ "has told is the worse for it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\r\n"
      		+ "said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It\r\n"
      		+ "is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at\r\n"
      		+ "present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\r\n"
      		+ "what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,\r\n"
      		+ "and handed it back, saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can\r\n"
      		+ "but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\r\n"
      		+ "honour you--as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with\r\n"
      		+ "another blush and a bright smile.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\r\n"
      		+ "and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\r\n"
      		+ "and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us\r\n"
      		+ "have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all\r\n"
      		+ "be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this\r\n"

      		+ "dinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of\r\n"
      		+ "board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to\r\n"
      		+ "which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit\r\n"
      		+ "next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat\r\n"

      		+ "“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts\r\n"

      		+ "something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.\r\n"
      		+ "So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure\r\n"

      		+ "teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane\r\n"

      		+ "like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being\r\n"
      		+ "stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is\r\n"
      		+ "amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of\r\n"
      		+ "cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have\r\n"
      		+ "still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the\r\n"
      		+ "divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are\r\n"
      		+ "for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in\r\n"
      		+ "callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear\r\n"
      		+ "at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he\r\n"
      		+ "can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the\r\n"
      		+ "thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and\r\n"
      		+ "the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become\r\n"
      		+ "small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to\r\n"
      		+ "begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having\r\n"
      		+ "found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible\r\n"
      		+ "task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave\r\n"
      		+ "shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then\r\n"
      		+ "where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not\r\n"
      		+ "mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward\r\n"
      		+ "become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,\r\n"
      		+ "preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for\r\n"
      		+ "ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?\r\n"
      		+ "We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God’s\r\n"
      		+ "sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face\r\n"
      		+ "to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;\r\n"
      		+ "but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his\r\n"

      		+ "saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so\r\n"
      		+ "strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for\r\n"

      		+ "his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with\r\n"
      		+ "his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our\r\n"
      		+ "solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even\r\n"
      		+ "occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing\r\n"
      		+ "went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\r\n"
      		+ "had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\r\n"
      		+ "as any other transaction of life:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\r\n"
      		+ "without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power\r\n"
      		+ "denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to\r\n"
      		+ "act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.\r\n"
      		+ "In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are\r\n"
      		+ "free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\r\n"
      		+ "achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\r\n"
      		+ "restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the\r\n"
      		+ "limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not\r\n"
      		+ "at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay\r\n"
      		+ "of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the\r\n"
      		+ "first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and\r\n"
      		+ "secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\r\n"
      		+ "superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for\r\n"
      		+ "others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would\r\n"
      		+ "have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\r\n"
      		+ "sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief\r\n"
      		+ "that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the\r\n"
      		+ "vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\r\n"
      		+ "moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\r\n"
      		+ "that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\r\n"
      		+ "all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so\r\n"
      		+ "far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at\r\n"
      		+ "this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\r\n"
      		+ "devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we\r\n"
      		+ "have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the\r\n"
      		+ "beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\r\n"
      		+ "experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the\r\n"
      		+ "time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the\r\n"
      		+ "living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\r\n"
      		+ "younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\r\n"
      		+ "they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he\r\n"
      		+ "cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!\r\n"
      		+ "He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\r\n"
      		+ "from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\r\n"
      		+ "from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\r\n"
      		+ "bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\r\n"
      		+ "saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\r\n"
      		+ "the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble\r\n"
      		+ "ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\r\n"
      		+ "he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He\r\n"
      		+ "come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\r\n"
      		+ "sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw\r\n"
      		+ "Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the\r\n"
      		+ "tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or\r\n"
      		+ "into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with\r\n"
      		+ "fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,\r\n"
      		+ "in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me\r\n"
      		+ "through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even\r\n"
      		+ "more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\r\n"
      		+ "He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey\r\n"
      		+ "some of nature’s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the\r\n"
      		+ "first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;\r\n"
      		+ "though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does\r\n"
      		+ "that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times\r\n"
      		+ "can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is\r\n"
      		+ "bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.\r\n"
      		+ "These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by\r\n"
      		+ "inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he\r\n"
      		+ "have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place\r\n"
      		+ "unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\r\n"
      		+ "Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is\r\n"
      		+ "said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\r\n"
      		+ "of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\r\n"
      		+ "power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\r\n"
      		+ "symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\r\n"
      		+ "them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\r\n"
      		+ "silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\r\n"
      		+ "lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his\r\n"
      		+ "coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\r\n"
      		+ "coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\r\n"
      		+ "him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.\r\n"
      		+ "We have seen it with our eyes.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\r\n"
      		+ "him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is\r\n"
      		+ "clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\r\n"
      		+ "make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he\r\n"
      		+ "has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his\r\n"
      		+ "name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\r\n"
      		+ "Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\r\n"
      		+ "and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most\r\n"
      		+ "cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the\r\n"
      		+ "forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his\r\n"
      		+ "grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says\r\n"
      		+ "Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who\r\n"
      		+ "were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They\r\n"
      		+ "learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake\r\n"
      		+ "Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the\r\n"
      		+ "records are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and\r\n"
      		+ "‘pokol’--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\r\n"
      		+ "spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have been\r\n"
      		+ "from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\r\n"
      		+ "graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it\r\n"
      		+ "is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\r\n"
      		+ "all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,\r\n"
      		+ "and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little\r\n"
      		+ "pause, and then the Professor went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must\r\n"
      		+ "proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\r\n"
      		+ "that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\r\n"
      		+ "were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes\r\n"
      		+ "have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to\r\n"
      		+ "ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\r\n"
      		+ "where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the\r\n"
      		+ "latter, we must trace----”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came\r\n"

      		+ "bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\r\n"
      		+ "far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\r\n"
      		+ "out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\r\n"

      		+ "“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But\r\n"
      		+ "the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat\r\n"
      		+ "and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned\r\n"
      		+ "brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\r\n"
      		+ "have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have\r\n"
      		+ "seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without\r\n"
      		+ "saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\r\n"

      		+ "no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men\r\n"

      		+ "_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an\r\n"
      		+ "urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see\r\n"
      		+ "him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.\r\n"
      		+ "I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\r\n"
      		+ "morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’t\r\n"
      		+ "know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his\r\n"
      		+ "violent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some\r\n"
      		+ "cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others to\r\n"
      		+ "wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your\r\n"
      		+ "diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_\r\n"
      		+ "case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\r\n"
      		+ "disturbed.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.\r\n"

      		+ "“Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, and\r\n"
      		+ "we all went down the passage together.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\r\n"
      		+ "rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an\r\n"
      		+ "unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever\r\n"
      		+ "met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would\r\n"
      		+ "prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but\r\n"
      		+ "none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would\r\n"
      		+ "at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up\r\n"
      		+ "with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own\r\n"
      		+ "existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said, “they will,\r\n"
      		+ "perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have\r\n"
      		+ "not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the oddness of\r\n"
      		+ "introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,\r\n"
      		+ "besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of\r\n"
      		+ "the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: “Lord\r\n"
      		+ "Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\r\n"
      		+ "Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\r\n"
      		+ "more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his\r\n"
      		+ "youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\r\n"
      		+ "patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great\r\n"
      		+ "state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\r\n"
      		+ "far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\r\n"
      		+ "alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a\r\n"
      		+ "vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\r\n"
      		+ "place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at\r\n"
      		+ "meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\r\n"
      		+ "conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\r\n"
      		+ "by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\r\n"
      		+ "conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to\r\n"
      		+ "one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by\r\n"
      		+ "the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\r\n"
      		+ "places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\r\n"
      		+ "least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.\r\n"
      		+ "And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\r\n"
      		+ "well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\r\n"
      		+ "be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last\r\n"
      		+ "appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\r\n"
      		+ "charm.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the\r\n"
      		+ "conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,\r\n"
      		+ "that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to\r\n"
      		+ "tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the\r\n"
      		+ "necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it\r\n"
      		+ "better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\r\n"
      		+ "I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.\r\n"
      		+ "So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\r\n"
      		+ "to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\r\n"
      		+ "in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of\r\n"
      		+ "meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\r\n"
      		+ "quickly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to\r\n"
      		+ "go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time\r\n"
      		+ "presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of\r\n"
      		+ "the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put\r\n"
      		+ "before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so\r\n"
      		+ "momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and\r\n"
      		+ "seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\r\n"
      		+ "them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\r\n"
      		+ "There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for\r\n"
      		+ "this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore\r\n"
      		+ "in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I\r\n"
      		+ "am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I\r\n"
      		+ "assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\r\n"
      		+ "unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,\r\n"
      		+ "sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which\r\n"
      		+ "animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of\r\n"
      		+ "your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing\r\n"
      		+ "conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was\r\n"
      		+ "but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let\r\n"
      		+ "him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like\r\n"
      		+ "all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at\r\n"
      		+ "him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\r\n"
      		+ "with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone\r\n"
      		+ "which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it\r\n"
      		+ "afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\r\n"
      		+ "to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\r\n"
      		+ "without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.\r\n"
      		+ "Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the\r\n"
      		+ "privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\r\n"
      		+ "poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the\r\n"
      		+ "highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\r\n"
      		+ "reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\r\n"
      		+ "you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If\r\n"
      		+ "you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\r\n"
      		+ "we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help\r\n"
      		+ "us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook\r\n"
      		+ "his head as he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and\r\n"
      		+ "if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my\r\n"
      		+ "own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am\r\n"
      		+ "refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was now\r\n"
      		+ "time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\r\n"
      		+ "towards the door, simply saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He\r\n"
      		+ "moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was\r\n"
      		+ "about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were\r\n"
      		+ "groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\r\n"
      		+ "petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his\r\n"
      		+ "emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\r\n"
      		+ "relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,\r\n"
      		+ "and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\r\n"
      		+ "fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\r\n"
      		+ "efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same\r\n"
      		+ "constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of\r\n"
      		+ "which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he\r\n"
      		+ "wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\r\n"
      		+ "sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,\r\n"
      		+ "for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\r\n"
      		+ "quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up\r\n"
      		+ "his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a\r\n"
      		+ "torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his\r\n"
      		+ "whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\r\n"
      		+ "of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;\r\n"
      		+ "send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a\r\n"
      		+ "strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go\r\n"
      		+ "out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am\r\n"
      		+ "speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don’t know\r\n"
      		+ "whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.\r\n"
      		+ "By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\r\n"
      		+ "lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out\r\n"
      		+ "of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t you\r\n"
      		+ "understand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and\r\n"
      		+ "earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\r\n"
      		+ "for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\r\n"
      		+ "would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough\r\n"
      		+ "already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,\r\n"
      		+ "without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the\r\n"

      		+ "serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it,\r\n"

      		+ "him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He\r\n"
      		+ "certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is\r\n"
      		+ "best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\r\n"
      		+ "help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand\r\n"
      		+ "on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\r\n"
      		+ "and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to\r\n"
      		+ "hope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped\r\n"
      		+ "away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver\r\n"
      		+ "whistle, as he remarked:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote on\r\n"
      		+ "call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\r\n"
      		+ "to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\r\n"
      		+ "out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out\r\n"
      		+ "a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\r\n"
      		+ "little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\r\n"
      		+ "many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the\r\n"
      		+ "strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\r\n"
      		+ "of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not\r\n"
      		+ "amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\r\n"
      		+ "in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him\r\n"
      		+ "as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his\r\n"
      		+ "touch. Keep this near your heart”--as he spoke he lifted a little silver\r\n"
      		+ "crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--“put these\r\n"
      		+ "flowers round your neck”--here he handed to me a wreath of withered\r\n"
      		+ "garlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this\r\n"
      		+ "knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can\r\n"
      		+ "fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,\r\n"
      		+ "which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of Sacred\r\n"
      		+ "Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others\r\n"
      		+ "was similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are the\r\n"
      		+ "skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house\r\n"
      		+ "by the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a\r\n"
      		+ "surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after\r\n"
      		+ "a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\r\n"
      		+ "clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\r\n"
      		+ "it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\r\n"
      		+ "Dr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb; I fancy that\r\n"
      		+ "the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\r\n"
      		+ "shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\r\n"
      		+ "into the open door.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“_In manus tuas, Domine!_” he said, crossing himself as he passed over\r\n"
      		+ "the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\r\n"
      		+ "lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The\r\n"
      		+ "Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\r\n"
      		+ "from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our\r\n"
      		+ "lamps and proceeded on our search.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\r\n"
      		+ "rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\r\n"
      		+ "shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\r\n"
      		+ "was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so\r\n"
      		+ "powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\r\n"
      		+ "experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,\r\n"
      		+ "for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\r\n"
      		+ "sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches\r\n"
      		+ "deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\r\n"
      		+ "my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The\r\n"
      		+ "walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\r\n"
      		+ "spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\r\n"
      		+ "tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the\r\n"
      		+ "hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They\r\n"
      		+ "had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\r\n"
      		+ "in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor\r\n"
      		+ "lifted them. He turned to me and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know\r\n"
      		+ "it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I had an\r\n"
      		+ "idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to\r\n"
      		+ "get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings\r\n"
      		+ "found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.\r\n"
      		+ "“This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small\r\n"
      		+ "map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence\r\n"
      		+ "regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the\r\n"
      		+ "bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for\r\n"
      		+ "as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale\r\n"
      		+ "through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we\r\n"
      		+ "encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close\r\n"
      		+ "quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of\r\n"
      		+ "his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in\r\n"
      		+ "a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and\r\n"
      		+ "close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was\r\n"
      		+ "an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler\r\n"
      		+ "air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not\r\n"
      		+ "alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the\r\n"
      		+ "pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had\r\n"
      		+ "become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath\r\n"
      		+ "exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\r\n"
      		+ "intensified its loathsomeness.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\r\n"
      		+ "enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\r\n"
      		+ "terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\r\n"
      		+ "above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking\r\n"
      		+ "consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\r\n"
      		+ "work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\r\n"
      		+ "began:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\r\n"
      		+ "examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some\r\n"
      		+ "clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to show\r\n"
      		+ "how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\r\n"
      		+ "no mistaking them.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,\r\n"
      		+ "for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\r\n"
      		+ "door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\r\n"
      		+ "heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\r\n"
      		+ "red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,\r\n"
      		+ "as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only the\r\n"
      		+ "shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\r\n"
      		+ "and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there\r\n"
      		+ "were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\r\n"
      		+ "walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I\r\n"
      		+ "took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\r\n"
      		+ "he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\r\n"
      		+ "undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\r\n"
      		+ "of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew\r\n"
      		+ "back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\r\n"
      		+ "seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great\r\n"
      		+ "iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,\r\n"
      		+ "and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\r\n"
      		+ "huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver\r\n"
      		+ "whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered\r\n"
      		+ "from behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a\r\n"
      		+ "minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.\r\n"
      		+ "Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\r\n"
      		+ "noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\r\n"
      		+ "taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had\r\n"
      		+ "elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their\r\n"
      		+ "moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look\r\n"
      		+ "like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the\r\n"
      		+ "threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\r\n"
      		+ "their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were\r\n"
      		+ "multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\r\n"
      		+ "on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before\r\n"
      		+ "him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\r\n"
      		+ "dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey\r\n"
      		+ "ere the whole mass had vanished.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\r\n"
      		+ "the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\r\n"
      		+ "their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\r\n"
      		+ "the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\r\n"
      		+ "Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of\r\n"
      		+ "the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves\r\n"
      		+ "in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something\r\n"
      		+ "of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our\r\n"
      		+ "resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and\r\n"
      		+ "bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found\r\n"
      		+ "nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all\r\n"
      		+ "untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.\r\n"
      		+ "Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\r\n"
      		+ "we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\r\n"
      		+ "rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\r\n"
      		+ "Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and\r\n"
      		+ "locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\r\n"
      		+ "when he had done.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm has\r\n"
      		+ "come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how\r\n"
      		+ "many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our\r\n"
      		+ "first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\r\n"
      		+ "accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or\r\n"
      		+ "troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\r\n"
      		+ "smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have\r\n"
      		+ "learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\r\n"
      		+ "beasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable\r\n"
      		+ "to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\r\n"
      		+ "call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\r\n"
      		+ "to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\r\n"
      		+ "from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters\r\n"
      		+ "before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\r\n"
      		+ "his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.\r\n"
      		+ "So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity\r\n"
      		+ "to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the\r\n"
      		+ "stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,\r\n"
      		+ "and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. It may be\r\n"
      		+ "ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\r\n"
      		+ "but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\r\n"
      		+ "was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\r\n"
      		+ "from Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\r\n"
      		+ "after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\r\n"
      		+ "softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than\r\n"
      		+ "usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly\r\n"
      		+ "thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\r\n"
      		+ "deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not\r\n"
      		+ "think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is\r\n"
      		+ "settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet\r\n"
      		+ "to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\r\n"
      		+ "suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a\r\n"
      		+ "sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all\r\n"
      		+ "is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I\r\n"
      		+ "daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such\r\n"
      		+ "confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep\r\n"

      		+ "_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\r\n"
      		+ "walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it\r\n"
      		+ "is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the\r\n"
      		+ "brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the\r\n"
      		+ "night he suddenly said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him\r\n"
      		+ "this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may\r\n"
      		+ "be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\r\n"
      		+ "and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him\r\n"
      		+ "that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to\r\n"
      		+ "keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary\r\n"
      		+ "instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against\r\n"
      		+ "getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I\r\n"
      		+ "want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live\r\n"
      		+ "things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that\r\n"
      		+ "he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on the\r\n"
      		+ "type-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that very\r\n"
      		+ "statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually\r\n"
      		+ "nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said.\r\n"
      		+ "“Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it\r\n"
      		+ "is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease\r\n"
      		+ "such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the\r\n"
      		+ "folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.\r\n"
      		+ "Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in\r\n"
      		+ "hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was\r\n"

      		+ "streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\r\n"
      		+ "across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\r\n"

      		+ "have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy\r\n"
      		+ "creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out\r\n"
      		+ "and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now\r\n"
      		+ "close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\r\n"
      		+ "wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\r\n"
      		+ "more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\r\n"
      		+ "I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\r\n"
      		+ "his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\r\n"

      		+ "fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\r\n"
      		+ "morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a\r\n"
      		+ "little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\r\n"
      		+ "bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\r\n"
      		+ "the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\r\n"
      		+ "was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\r\n"
      		+ "hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\r\n"
      		+ "usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\r\n"
      		+ "upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\r\n"
      		+ "clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\r\n"
      		+ "around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\r\n"
      		+ "came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\r\n"
      		+ "grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\r\n"
      		+ "had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\r\n"
      		+ "make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\r\n"
      		+ "limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\r\n"
      		+ "my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\r\n"
      		+ "tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\r\n"
      		+ "mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\r\n"
      		+ "could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling\r\n"
      		+ "water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\r\n"
      		+ "the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\r\n"
      		+ "concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\r\n"
      		+ "of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\r\n"
      		+ "began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\r\n"
      		+ "whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a\r\n"
      		+ "pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such\r\n"
      		+ "spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\r\n"
      		+ "composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\r\n"
      		+ "red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\r\n"
      		+ "looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\r\n"
      		+ "two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\r\n"
      		+ "when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s\r\n"
      		+ "Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan\r\n"
      		+ "had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\r\n"
      		+ "in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\r\n"
      		+ "black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to\r\n"
      		+ "show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be\r\n"
      		+ "careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were\r\n"
      		+ "too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe\r\n"
      		+ "something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm\r\n"
      		+ "them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their\r\n"
      		+ "fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do\r\n"
      		+ "not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that\r\n"
      		+ "cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’s sleep. Last\r\n"

      		+ "difficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I asked\r\n"
      		+ "for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had found\r\n"
      		+ "the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging-house.\r\n"
      		+ "When I asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his\r\n"
      		+ "head, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never\r\n"
      		+ "’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobody\r\n"
      		+ "of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, and\r\n"
      		+ "as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\r\n"
      		+ "of the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right\r\n"
      		+ "track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\r\n"
      		+ "deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\r\n"
      		+ "had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\r\n"
      		+ "Corcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that\r\n"
      		+ "morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\r\n"
      		+ "he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”;\r\n"
      		+ "and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\r\n"
      		+ "o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\r\n"
      		+ "I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\r\n"
      		+ "of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\r\n"
      		+ "new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a\r\n"
      		+ "“new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\r\n"
      		+ "gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\r\n"
      		+ "coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\r\n"
      		+ "suggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for\r\n"
      		+ "the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\r\n"
      		+ "a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\r\n"
      		+ "promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\r\n"
      		+ "that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\r\n"
      		+ "and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“main\r\n"
      		+ "heavy ones”--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\r\n"
      		+ "asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\r\n"
      		+ "which he replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\r\n"
      		+ "big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\r\n"
      		+ "dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we\r\n"
      		+ "tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at\r\n"
      		+ "Purfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\r\n"
      		+ "me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller,\r\n"
      		+ "with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throw\r\n"
      		+ "a shadder.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "How this phrase thrilled through me!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\r\n"
      		+ "me a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an’ I’m no\r\n"
      		+ "chicken, neither.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for\r\n"
      		+ "when I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me\r\n"
      		+ "to carry the boxes into the ’all.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The whole nine?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was\r\n"
      		+ "main dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I\r\n"
      		+ "interrupted him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Were the boxes left in the hall?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made one\r\n"
      		+ "more attempt to further matters:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You didn’t have any key?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door ’isself\r\n"
      		+ "an’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last time--but\r\n"
      		+ "that was the beer.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And you can’t remember the number of the house?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’un\r\n"
      		+ "with a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. I\r\n"
      		+ "know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\r\n"
      		+ "what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’\r\n"
      		+ "they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them\r\n"
      		+ "by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot\r\n"
      		+ "of them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I could\r\n"
      		+ "find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\r\n"
      		+ "off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\r\n"
      		+ "could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\r\n"
      		+ "precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\r\n"
      		+ "distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\r\n"
      		+ "unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\r\n"
      		+ "westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\r\n"
      		+ "described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\r\n"
      		+ "arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\r\n"
      		+ "untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\r\n"
      		+ "up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\r\n"
      		+ "had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\r\n"
      		+ "a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\r\n"
      		+ "roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\r\n"
      		+ "Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\r\n"
      		+ "whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\r\n"
      		+ "been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\r\n"
      		+ "given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\r\n"
      		+ "experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\r\n"
      		+ "but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\r\n"
      		+ "discovered of gaining access to the house.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\r\n"
      		+ "nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\r\n"
      		+ "could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\r\n"
      		+ "Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\r\n"
      		+ "grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\r\n"
      		+ "about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\r\n"
      		+ "taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\r\n"
      		+ "very lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that\r\n"
      		+ "perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\r\n"
      		+ "something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\r\n"
      		+ "the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\r\n"
      		+ "or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\r\n"
      		+ "away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\r\n"
      		+ "did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\r\n"
      		+ "Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\r\n"
      		+ "Sackville Street.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\r\n"
      		+ "uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\r\n"
      		+ "Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\r\n"
      		+ "“mansion”--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\r\n"
      		+ "asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\r\n"
      		+ "paused a few seconds before replying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is sold, sir.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special reason\r\n"
      		+ "for wishing to know who purchased it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is sold,\r\n"
      		+ "sir,” was again his laconic reply.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are\r\n"
      		+ "absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This was\r\n"
      		+ "manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\r\n"
      		+ "him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\r\n"
      		+ "confidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card.\r\n"
      		+ "“In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\r\n"
      		+ "Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\r\n"
      		+ "he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion\r\n"
      		+ "on affairs. He said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\r\n"
      		+ "I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\r\n"
      		+ "renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\r\n"
      		+ "Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consult\r\n"
      		+ "the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\r\n"
      		+ "lordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\r\n"
      		+ "deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\r\n"
      		+ "lordship.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\r\n"
      		+ "gave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark, and I\r\n"
      		+ "was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company\r\n"
      		+ "and came down to Purfleet by the next train.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\r\n"
      		+ "made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\r\n"
      		+ "think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\r\n"
      		+ "inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\r\n"
      		+ "our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\r\n"
      		+ "confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\r\n"
      		+ "keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\r\n"
      		+ "else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\r\n"
      		+ "any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\r\n"
      		+ "made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge would be torture to her.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;\r\n"
      		+ "so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\r\n"
      		+ "amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\r\n"
      		+ "The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\r\n"
      		+ "as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\r\n"
      		+ "came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\r\n"
      		+ "difference between us.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\r\n"
      		+ "the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\r\n"
      		+ "it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\r\n"
      		+ "information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\r\n"
      		+ "the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\r\n"
      		+ "our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\r\n"
      		+ "until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\r\n"
      		+ "wretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Morris spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\r\n"
      		+ "and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\r\n"
      		+ "commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’t\r\n"
      		+ "see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\r\n"
      		+ "of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\r\n"
      		+ "morning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\r\n"
      		+ "about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\r\n"
      		+ "another of us:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\r\n"
      		+ "got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\r\n"
      		+ "can find the Count’s key basket.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\r\n"
      		+ "least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell’s,\r\n"
      		+ "we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\r\n"
      		+ "while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\r\n"
      		+ "bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\r\n"
      		+ "moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\r\n"
      		+ "forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\r\n"
      		+ "in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\r\n"
      		+ "did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\r\n"
      		+ "herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\r\n"

      		+ "_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\r\n"
      		+ "rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\r\n"
      		+ "always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\r\n"
      		+ "than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\r\n"
      		+ "repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\r\n"
      		+ "He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really\r\n"
      		+ "care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\r\n"
      		+ "looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\r\n"
      		+ "thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\r\n"
      		+ "him:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superior\r\n"
      		+ "sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\r\n"
      		+ "he answered me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\r\n"
      		+ "of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\r\n"
      		+ "when they typified the soul as a butterfly!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\r\n"
      		+ "quickly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his\r\n"
      		+ "reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\r\n"
      		+ "with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he brightened\r\n"
      		+ "up; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\r\n"
      		+ "have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\r\n"
      		+ "study zoöphagy!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--\r\n"

      		+ "“Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\r\n"
      		+ "Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\r\n"
      		+ "may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\r\n"
      		+ "purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\r\n"
      		+ "spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\r\n"
      		+ "Enoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\r\n"
      		+ "that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--\r\n"

      		+ "“And why with Enoch?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not\r\n"

      		+ "“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I put\r\n"
      		+ "my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\r\n"

      		+ "I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat them\r\n"
      		+ "or----” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\r\n"
      		+ "face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as to\r\n"
      		+ "life, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and you\r\n"
      		+ "know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good\r\n"
      		+ "friends--like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer of\r\n"

      		+ "was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\r\n"
      		+ "without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\r\n"
      		+ "that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\r\n"

      		+ "record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\r\n"
      		+ "to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\r\n"
      		+ "me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\r\n"
      		+ "might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\r\n"
      		+ "might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\r\n"
      		+ "alone.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\r\n"
      		+ "which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\r\n"
      		+ "came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\r\n"
      		+ "lips:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been\r\n"
      		+ "correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\r\n"
      		+ "lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them\r\n"
      		+ "yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\r\n"
      		+ "him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\r\n"
      		+ "an answer.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\r\n"
      		+ "matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to “be\r\n"
      		+ "cruel only to be kind.” So I said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You like life, and you want life?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul\r\n"
      		+ "also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with\r\n"
      		+ "the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\r\n"
      		+ "and twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, you\r\n"
      		+ "know, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affect\r\n"
      		+ "his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\r\n"
      		+ "screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\r\n"
      		+ "soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\r\n"
      		+ "me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\r\n"
      		+ "though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\r\n"
      		+ "was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\r\n"
      		+ "and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\r\n"
      		+ "to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\r\n"
      		+ "go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\r\n"
      		+ "speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added,\r\n"
      		+ "“But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Or spiders?” I went on.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in them\r\n"
      		+ "to eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\r\n"
      		+ "topic.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenly\r\n"
      		+ "stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed himself\r\n"
      		+ "aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\r\n"
      		+ "my attention from it:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such\r\n"
      		+ "small deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they\r\n"
      		+ "might be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\r\n"
      		+ "ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\r\n"
      		+ "interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\r\n"
      		+ "me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meet\r\n"
      		+ "in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wide\r\n"
      		+ "awake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I said\r\n"
      		+ "reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\r\n"
      		+ "high-horse and became a child again.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a\r\n"
      		+ "few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\r\n"
      		+ "his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To\r\n"
      		+ "hell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me about\r\n"
      		+ "souls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\r\n"
      		+ "without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I thought he was\r\n"
      		+ "in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\r\n"
      		+ "however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\r\n"
      		+ "worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\r\n"
      		+ "problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\r\n"
      		+ "tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\r\n"
      		+ "want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\r\n"
      		+ "sure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when the\r\n"
      		+ "attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\r\n"
      		+ "watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in this\r\n"

      		+ "“I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\r\n"

      		+ "fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\r\n"
      		+ "Professor thought a moment and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\r\n"
      		+ "as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\r\n"
      		+ "his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\r\n"
      		+ "brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\r\n"
      		+ "too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\r\n"
      		+ "went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\r\n"
      		+ "Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\r\n"
      		+ "So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\r\n"
      		+ "are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\r\n"
      		+ "these times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\r\n"
      		+ "as they have been. We’ll have to look back--and forward a little more\r\n"
      		+ "than we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open\r\n"
      		+ "till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\r\n"
      		+ "attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\r\n"
      		+ "floor, he said softly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him\r\n"
      		+ "briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\r\n"
      		+ "the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\r\n"
      		+ "down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\r\n"
      		+ "in patience.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We shall wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enough to fix the best\r\n"
      		+ "spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\r\n"
      		+ "the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\r\n"
      		+ "horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing’s face I gathered\r\n"
      		+ "that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\r\n"
      		+ "the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\r\n"
      		+ "but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\r\n"
      		+ "who have heard the death-watch. The poor man’s breathing came in\r\n"
      		+ "uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\r\n"
      		+ "and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\r\n"
      		+ "would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\r\n"
      		+ "beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\r\n"
      		+ "hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\r\n"
      		+ "temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\r\n"
      		+ "agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\r\n"
      		+ "their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\r\n"
      		+ "torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\r\n"
      		+ "some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\r\n"
      		+ "it.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\r\n"
      		+ "sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\r\n"
      		+ "and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\r\n"
      		+ "spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\r\n"
      		+ "been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\r\n"
      		+ "We shall operate just above the ear.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\r\n"
      		+ "breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\r\n"
      		+ "prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\r\n"
      		+ "Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\r\n"
      		+ "This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\r\n"
      		+ "surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\r\n"
      		+ "convulsively, and as he did so, said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\r\n"
      		+ "have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\r\n"
      		+ "move. What’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\r\n"
      		+ "dreadfully.” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\r\n"
      		+ "eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his face\r\n"
      		+ "brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\r\n"
      		+ "water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed”--he\r\n"
      		+ "stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--“The\r\n"
      		+ "brandy--it is in my study--quick!” He flew and returned with a glass,\r\n"
      		+ "the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\r\n"
      		+ "lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\r\n"
      		+ "injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\r\n"
      		+ "conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\r\n"
      		+ "shall never forget, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.”\r\n"
      		+ "Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\r\n"
      		+ "figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“If I were not sure already, I would know from them.” For an instant his\r\n"
      		+ "eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\r\n"
      		+ "bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\r\n"
      		+ "hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\r\n"
      		+ "and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\r\n"
      		+ "again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\r\n"
      		+ "crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\r\n"
      		+ "me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn’t speak then, for I\r\n"
      		+ "felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\r\n"
      		+ "I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\r\n"
      		+ "me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\r\n"
      		+ "dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\r\n"
      		+ "gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\r\n"
      		+ "and said: “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\r\n"
      		+ "but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\r\n"
      		+ "man’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\r\n"
      		+ "teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\r\n"
      		+ "of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come in\r\n"
      		+ "at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\r\n"
      		+ "Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.” He\r\n"
      		+ "was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\r\n"
      		+ "sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\r\n"
      		+ "wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\r\n"
      		+ "backs.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\r\n"
      		+ "‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\r\n"
      		+ "millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\r\n"
      		+ "too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\r\n"
      		+ "buzzing flies!’ I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\r\n"
      		+ "Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\r\n"
      		+ "beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\r\n"
      		+ "hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\r\n"
      		+ "spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\r\n"
      		+ "then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\r\n"
      		+ "were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\r\n"
      		+ "smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\r\n"
      		+ "and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\r\n"
      		+ "me!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\r\n"
      		+ "over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\r\n"
      		+ "the sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!’ The rats were\r\n"
      		+ "all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\r\n"
      		+ "open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\r\n"
      		+ "the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\r\n"
      		+ "splendour.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\r\n"
      		+ "he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\r\n"
      		+ "the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\r\n"
      		+ "back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: “Let him go on. Do\r\n"
      		+ "not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\r\n"
      		+ "if once he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\r\n"
      		+ "even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\r\n"
      		+ "When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\r\n"
      		+ "knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\r\n"
      		+ "out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\r\n"
      		+ "owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn’t even smell the same\r\n"
      		+ "as he went by me. I couldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker had come into the room.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\r\n"
      		+ "him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\r\n"
      		+ "They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\r\n"
      		+ "however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\r\n"
      		+ "noticing:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same;\r\n"
      		+ "it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we all moved,\r\n"
      		+ "but no one said a word; he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the\r\n"
      		+ "same. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\r\n"
      		+ "in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think of it\r\n"
      		+ "at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\r\n"
      		+ "to know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I could feel that\r\n"
      		+ "the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. “So when\r\n"
      		+ "He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\r\n"
      		+ "grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\r\n"
      		+ "as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\r\n"
      		+ "Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\r\n"
      		+ "with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn’t\r\n"
      		+ "mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\r\n"
      		+ "into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\r\n"
      		+ "when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\r\n"
      		+ "was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and his\r\n"
      		+ "breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his purpose.\r\n"
      		+ "It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\r\n"
      		+ "night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.” There was no\r\n"
      		+ "need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\r\n"
      		+ "common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\r\n"
      		+ "had when we entered the Count’s house. The Professor had his ready, and\r\n"
      		+ "as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\r\n"
      		+ "over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\r\n"
      		+ "Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!” He stopped; his\r\n"
      		+ "voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\r\n"
      		+ "my own heart.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Outside the Harkers’ door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\r\n"
      		+ "latter said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Should we disturb her?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We must,” said Van Helsing grimly. “If the door be locked, I shall\r\n"
      		+ "break it in.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady’s\r\n"
      		+ "room!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing said solemnly, “You are always right; but this is life and\r\n"
      		+ "death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\r\n"
      		+ "are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\r\n"
      		+ "the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\r\n"
      		+ "too, my friends. Now!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\r\n"
      		+ "ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\r\n"
      		+ "headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\r\n"
      		+ "across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\r\n"
      		+ "appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\r\n"
      		+ "and my heart seemed to stand still.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\r\n"
      		+ "was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\r\n"
      		+ "Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\r\n"
      		+ "Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\r\n"
      		+ "figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\r\n"
      		+ "His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\r\n"
      		+ "the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\r\n"
      		+ "hand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms\r\n"
      		+ "at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\r\n"
      		+ "forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\r\n"
      		+ "with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which\r\n"
      		+ "was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\r\n"
      		+ "resemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into a saucer of milk to\r\n"
      		+ "compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\r\n"
      		+ "face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\r\n"
      		+ "into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\r\n"
      		+ "of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\r\n"
      		+ "white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\r\n"
      		+ "champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\r\n"
      		+ "his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\r\n"
      		+ "and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\r\n"
      		+ "and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\r\n"
      		+ "Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\r\n"
      		+ "the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\r\n"
      		+ "lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\r\n"
      		+ "great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\r\n"
      		+ "under Quincey’s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\r\n"
      		+ "looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\r\n"
      		+ "open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\r\n"
      		+ "forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\r\n"
      		+ "it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\r\n"
      		+ "seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\r\n"
      		+ "few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\r\n"
      		+ "ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\r\n"
      		+ "her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\r\n"
      		+ "blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\r\n"
      		+ "poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\r\n"
      		+ "Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\r\n"
      		+ "which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\r\n"
      		+ "endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\r\n"
      		+ "over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\r\n"
      		+ "despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\r\n"
      		+ "do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\r\n"
      		+ "herself; I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\r\n"
      		+ "and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\r\n"
      		+ "holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\r\n"
      		+ "heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\r\n"
      		+ "window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\r\n"
      		+ "Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\r\n"
      		+ "yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\r\n"
      		+ "instant I heard Harker’s quick exclamation as he woke to partial\r\n"
      		+ "consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\r\n"
      		+ "be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\r\n"
      		+ "then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\r\n"
      		+ "started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\r\n"
      		+ "him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\r\n"
      		+ "however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\r\n"
      		+ "her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr.\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\r\n"
      		+ "what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\r\n"
      		+ "this!” and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\r\n"
      		+ "together. “Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!” With a quick\r\n"
      		+ "movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\r\n"
      		+ "man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “What has happened?\r\n"
      		+ "Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you\r\n"
      		+ "love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\r\n"
      		+ "far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!” His wife, through her terror\r\n"
      		+ "and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\r\n"
      		+ "forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\r\n"
      		+ "to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\r\n"
      		+ "with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!” Her\r\n"
      		+ "expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\r\n"
      		+ "pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\r\n"
      		+ "little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\r\n"
      		+ "foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\r\n"
      		+ "and take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down\r\n"
      		+ "her head on her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his white\r\n"
      		+ "night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\r\n"
      		+ "the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\r\n"
      		+ "saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\r\n"
      		+ "sobs:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\r\n"
      		+ "should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\r\n"
      		+ "most cause to fear.” To this he spoke out resolutely:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\r\n"
      		+ "hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\r\n"
      		+ "deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\r\n"
      		+ "if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out\r\n"
      		+ "his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\r\n"
      		+ "sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\r\n"
      		+ "damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\r\n"
      		+ "while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\r\n"
      		+ "me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\r\n"
      		+ "power to the utmost:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\r\n"
      		+ "fact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened,\r\n"
      		+ "and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\r\n"
      		+ "and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\r\n"
      		+ "held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\r\n"
      		+ "the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\r\n"
      		+ "see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\r\n"
      		+ "the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\r\n"
      		+ "hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\r\n"
      		+ "They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\r\n"
      		+ "questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\r\n"
      		+ "their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\r\n"
      		+ "and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\r\n"
      		+ "to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\r\n"
      		+ "answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\r\n"
      		+ "looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\r\n"
      		+ "however----” He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\r\n"
      		+ "the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\r\n"
      		+ "is in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\r\n"
      		+ "seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\r\n"
      		+ "burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\r\n"
      		+ "cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\r\n"
      		+ "had helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is the\r\n"
      		+ "other copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\r\n"
      		+ "went on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\r\n"
      		+ "into Renfield’s room; but there was no trace there except----!” Again he\r\n"
      		+ "paused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\r\n"
      		+ "moistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow\r\n"
      		+ "is dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\r\n"
      		+ "us she said solemnly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\r\n"
      		+ "something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually, but at present I\r\n"
      		+ "can’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\r\n"
      		+ "go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\r\n"
      		+ "Renfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\r\n"
      		+ "shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\r\n"
      		+ "will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\r\n"
      		+ "dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\r\n"
      		+ "a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\r\n"
      		+ "hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\r\n"
      		+ "hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker’s head:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\r\n"
      		+ "happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\r\n"
      		+ "need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\r\n"
      		+ "quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\r\n"
      		+ "end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\r\n"
      		+ "learn.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\r\n"
      		+ "as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\r\n"
      		+ "lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\r\n"
      		+ "out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\r\n"
      		+ "kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\r\n"
      		+ "of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\r\n"
      		+ "After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\r\n"
      		+ "began:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\r\n"
      		+ "long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\r\n"
      		+ "of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\r\n"
      		+ "connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”\r\n"
      		+ "Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\r\n"
      		+ "lovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\r\n"
      		+ "through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\r\n"
      		+ "to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\r\n"
      		+ "need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\r\n"
      		+ "with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\r\n"
      		+ "sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\r\n"
      		+ "more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\r\n"
      		+ "next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\r\n"
      		+ "had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\r\n"
      		+ "it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\r\n"
      		+ "terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\r\n"
      		+ "I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\r\n"
      		+ "seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\r\n"
      		+ "tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\r\n"
      		+ "looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\r\n"
      		+ "the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\r\n"
      		+ "had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\r\n"
      		+ "tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\r\n"
      		+ "the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\r\n"
      		+ "fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\r\n"
      		+ "teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\r\n"
      		+ "sunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\r\n"
      		+ "red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\r\n"
      		+ "my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\r\n"
      		+ "paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\r\n"
      		+ "pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\r\n"
      		+ "before your very eyes.’ I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\r\n"
      		+ "say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\r\n"
      		+ "and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\r\n"
      		+ "so, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\r\n"
      		+ "be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\r\n"
      		+ "appeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\r\n"
      		+ "want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\r\n"
      		+ "such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\r\n"
      		+ "me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groaned\r\n"
      		+ "again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\r\n"
      		+ "he were the injured one, and went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\r\n"
      		+ "this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\r\n"
      		+ "must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\r\n"
      		+ "saw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance seemed for a while to\r\n"
      		+ "overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\r\n"
      		+ "husband’s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\r\n"
      		+ "went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then he spoke to me mockingly, ‘And so you, like the others, would play\r\n"
      		+ "your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\r\n"
      		+ "frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\r\n"
      		+ "and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They\r\n"
      		+ "should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\r\n"
      		+ "played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\r\n"
      		+ "for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\r\n"
      		+ "born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\r\n"
      		+ "to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\r\n"
      		+ "wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\r\n"
      		+ "helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\r\n"
      		+ "minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\r\n"
      		+ "have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\r\n"
      		+ "call. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea to\r\n"
      		+ "do my bidding; and to that end this!’ With that he pulled open his\r\n"
      		+ "shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\r\n"
      		+ "the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\r\n"
      		+ "them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\r\n"
      		+ "the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\r\n"
      		+ "my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\r\n"
      		+ "fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\r\n"
      		+ "days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\r\n"
      		+ "and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” Then she began to rub her\r\n"
      		+ "lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\r\n"
      		+ "and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;\r\n"
      		+ "but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\r\n"
      		+ "which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\r\n"
      		+ "red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\r\n"

      		+ "_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\r\n"
      		+ "is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\r\n"
      		+ "take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\r\n"
      		+ "that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\r\n"
      		+ "knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\r\n"
      		+ "not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\r\n"
      		+ "the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\r\n"
      		+ "not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\r\n"
      		+ "we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\r\n"
      		+ "running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\r\n"
      		+ "faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\r\n"
      		+ "Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\r\n"
      		+ "told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\r\n"
      		+ "they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\r\n"
      		+ "all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\r\n"
      		+ "heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\r\n"
      		+ "half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\r\n"
      		+ "had called out loudly several times, “God! God! God!” after that there\r\n"
      		+ "was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\r\n"
      		+ "on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\r\n"
      		+ "asked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and he said he could not\r\n"
      		+ "say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\r\n"
      		+ "there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\r\n"
      		+ "to it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken by the patient. Dr.\r\n"
      		+ "Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\r\n"
      		+ "the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\r\n"
      		+ "would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\r\n"
      		+ "it was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidence he could give a\r\n"
      		+ "certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\r\n"
      		+ "coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\r\n"

      		+ "despair. “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had\r\n"
      		+ "too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\r\n"
      		+ "give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\r\n"
      		+ "Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\r\n"
      		+ "but quietly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\r\n"
      		+ "others from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in its\r\n"
      		+ "lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\r\n"
      		+ "answered:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\r\n"
      		+ "our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\r\n"
      		+ "came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\r\n"
      		+ "harm to any that I love, I shall die!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\r\n"
      		+ "pain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him meaningly as she\r\n"
      		+ "spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\r\n"
      		+ "put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\r\n"
      		+ "could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\r\n"
      		+ "even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\r\n"
      		+ "child----” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\r\n"
      		+ "throat; he gulped it down and went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\r\n"
      		+ "die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\r\n"
      		+ "the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\r\n"
      		+ "die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\r\n"
      		+ "you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\r\n"
      		+ "live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\r\n"
      		+ "himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\r\n"
      		+ "night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\r\n"
      		+ "do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” The\r\n"
      		+ "poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\r\n"
      		+ "quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\r\n"
      		+ "silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\r\n"
      		+ "him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\r\n"
      		+ "strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\r\n"
      		+ "have passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all felt\r\n"
      		+ "that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\r\n"
      		+ "began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\r\n"
      		+ "the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\r\n"
      		+ "might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\r\n"
      		+ "She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” could\r\n"
      		+ "be used in connection with so grim an interest.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\r\n"
      		+ "prepared with an exact ordering of our work.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to\r\n"
      		+ "Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\r\n"
      		+ "there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\r\n"
      		+ "would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\r\n"
      		+ "effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\r\n"
      		+ "intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\r\n"
      		+ "power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\r\n"
      		+ "them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\r\n"
      		+ "to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\r\n"
      		+ "Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\r\n"
      		+ "and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\r\n"
      		+ "guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\r\n"
      		+ "retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\r\n"
      		+ "of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\r\n"
      		+ "through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\r\n"
      		+ "must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\r\n"
      		+ "all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\r\n"
      		+ "him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\r\n"
      		+ "and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I\r\n"
      		+ "could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\r\n"
      		+ "preciously laden with Mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,\r\n"
      		+ "since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\r\n"
      		+ "his hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the\r\n"
      		+ "quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\r\n"
      		+ "act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\r\n"
      		+ "all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\r\n"
      		+ "The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\r\n"
      		+ "deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\r\n"
      		+ "write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\r\n"
      		+ "that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\r\n"
      		+ "where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\r\n"
      		+ "very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\r\n"
      		+ "search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\r\n"
      		+ "friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we\r\n"
      		+ "run down our old fox--so? is it not?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious,\r\n"
      		+ "precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\r\n"
      		+ "reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Don’t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\r\n"
      		+ "in.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\r\n"
      		+ "your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\r\n"
      		+ "movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\r\n"
      		+ "seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\r\n"
      		+ "into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I nodded.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\r\n"
      		+ "not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the\r\n"
      		+ "housebreaker, what would you do?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\r\n"
      		+ "lock for me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in doubt is\r\n"
      		+ "the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\r\n"
      		+ "whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\r\n"
      		+ "police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\r\n"
      		+ "the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\r\n"
      		+ "friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this\r\n"
      		+ "your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such\r\n"
      		+ "things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,\r\n"
      		+ "no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine\r\n"
      		+ "house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland\r\n"
      		+ "and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and\r\n"
      		+ "got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out\r\n"
      		+ "and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he\r\n"
      		+ "have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;\r\n"
      		+ "and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of\r\n"
      		+ "that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him\r\n"
      		+ "that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away\r\n"
      		+ "within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all\r\n"
      		+ "they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland\r\n"
      		+ "he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done\r\n"
      		+ "_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go\r\n"
      		+ "so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem\r\n"
      		+ "it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many\r\n"
      		+ "about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the\r\n"
      		+ "house.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina’s\r\n"
      		+ "face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\r\n"
      		+ "us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\r\n"
      		+ "more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Lord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,” he said. “I shall\r\n"
      		+ "wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\r\n"
      		+ "convenient.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have all\r\n"
      		+ "ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one\r\n"
      		+ "of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of\r\n"
      		+ "Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?\r\n"
      		+ "It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\r\n"
      		+ "even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “His head is what you\r\n"
      		+ "call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to\r\n"
      		+ "do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\r\n"
      		+ "that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\r\n"
      		+ "terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost\r\n"
      		+ "ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\r\n"
      		+ "somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give\r\n"
      		+ "her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\r\n"
      		+ "what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As\r\n"
      		+ "yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\r\n"
      		+ "was short, and there was time for fear.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the\r\n"
      		+ "disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was\r\n"
      		+ "finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\r\n"
      		+ "Count’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we\r\n"
      		+ "should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\r\n"
      		+ "presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\r\n"
      		+ "some new clue.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\r\n"
      		+ "after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\r\n"
      		+ "that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\r\n"
      		+ "and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.\r\n"
      		+ "It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count\r\n"
      		+ "might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be\r\n"
      		+ "able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to\r\n"
      		+ "follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as\r\n"
      		+ "my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect\r\n"
      		+ "Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would\r\n"
      		+ "not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter\r\n"
      		+ "in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count’s papers might be\r\n"
      		+ "some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;\r\n"
      		+ "and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to\r\n"
      		+ "cope with the Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina’s\r\n"
      		+ "resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that\r\n"
      		+ "we should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear.\r\n"
      		+ "Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must\r\n"
      		+ "have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if\r\n"
      		+ "He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.” So I\r\n"
      		+ "started up crying out: “Then in God’s name let us come at once, for we\r\n"
      		+ "are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we\r\n"
      		+ "think.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night he\r\n"
      		+ "banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that\r\n"
      		+ "terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\r\n"
      		+ "the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\r\n"
      		+ "shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her\r\n"
      		+ "frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in\r\n"
      		+ "the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,\r\n"
      		+ "he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh,\r\n"
      		+ "Madam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so\r\n"
      		+ "reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old\r\n"
      		+ "lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will\r\n"
      		+ "forget it, will you not?” He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took\r\n"
      		+ "his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I\r\n"
      		+ "have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\r\n"
      		+ "together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we\r\n"
      		+ "must all eat that we may be strong.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and\r\n"
      		+ "encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\r\n"
      		+ "us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we\r\n"
      		+ "all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s\r\n"
      		+ "lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all assured\r\n"
      		+ "him. “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\r\n"
      		+ "here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall\r\n"
      		+ "return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I\r\n"
      		+ "have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\r\n"
      		+ "of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard\r\n"
      		+ "yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the\r\n"
      		+ "name of the Father, the Son, and----”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he\r\n"
      		+ "had placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burned\r\n"
      		+ "into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor\r\n"
      		+ "darling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as\r\n"
      		+ "her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that\r\n"
      		+ "her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the\r\n"
      		+ "words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased\r\n"
      		+ "to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her\r\n"
      		+ "knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair\r\n"
      		+ "over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must\r\n"
      		+ "bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.” They\r\n"
      		+ "all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\r\n"
      		+ "grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our\r\n"
      		+ "sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\r\n"
      		+ "their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said\r\n"
      		+ "gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\r\n"
      		+ "way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--\r\n"

      		+ "the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\r\n"
      		+ "began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling\r\n"
      		+ "about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the\r\n"
      		+ "door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. It did\r\n"
      		+ "indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\r\n"
      		+ "previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the\r\n"
      		+ "place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together\r\n"
      		+ "in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal\r\n"
      		+ "with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the\r\n"
      		+ "house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found\r\n"
      		+ "eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!\r\n"
      		+ "Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the\r\n"
      		+ "missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out\r\n"
      		+ "across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,\r\n"
      		+ "pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no\r\n"
      		+ "windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not\r\n"
      		+ "lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had\r\n"
      		+ "brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\r\n"
      		+ "treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the\r\n"
      		+ "Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for\r\n"
      		+ "any of his effects.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,\r\n"
      		+ "we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\r\n"
      		+ "which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\r\n"
      		+ "them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\r\n"
      		+ "table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;\r\n"
      		+ "deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\r\n"
      		+ "note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin\r\n"
      		+ "wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes\r\n"
      		+ "brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\r\n"
      		+ "dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a\r\n"
      		+ "little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\r\n"
      		+ "the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\r\n"
      		+ "and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the\r\n"
      		+ "houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\r\n"
      		+ "bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us\r\n"

      		+ "the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep\r\n"
      		+ "our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent\r\n"
      		+ "purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.\r\n"
      		+ "The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.\r\n"
      		+ "Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful\r\n"

      		+ "haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning\r\n"
      		+ "eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in\r\n"

      		+ "all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,\r\n"
      		+ "in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I\r\n"
      		+ "thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows\r\n"
      		+ "this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he\r\n"
      		+ "has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So\r\n"
      		+ "well as I can remember, here it is:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all\r\n"
      		+ "the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the\r\n"
      		+ "greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there\r\n"
      		+ "are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of\r\n"
      		+ "it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,\r\n"
      		+ "he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and\r\n"
      		+ "alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\r\n"
      		+ "science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\r\n"
      		+ "compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to\r\n"
      		+ "attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time\r\n"
      		+ "that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the\r\n"
      		+ "physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.\r\n"
      		+ "In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\r\n"
      		+ "growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\r\n"
      		+ "man’s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\r\n"
      		+ "been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\r\n"
      		+ "fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\r\n"
      		+ "lead through Death, not Life.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Harker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my darling!\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\r\n"
      		+ "surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as\r\n"
      		+ "yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\r\n"
      		+ "things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means\r\n"
      		+ "to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\r\n"

      		+ "see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He\r\n"
      		+ "knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great\r\n"
      		+ "child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\r\n"
      		+ "might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he\r\n"
      		+ "found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he\r\n"
      		+ "progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\r\n"
      		+ "they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So\r\n"
      		+ "that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his\r\n"
      		+ "form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his\r\n"
      		+ "hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him\r\n"
      		+ "just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;\r\n"
      		+ "and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he\r\n"
      		+ "can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is\r\n"
      		+ "there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even\r\n"
      		+ "more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be\r\n"
      		+ "well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our\r\n"
      		+ "day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are\r\n"
      		+ "five of us when those absent ones return.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the\r\n"

      		+ "before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for\r\n"
      		+ "is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, there\r\n"
      		+ "came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary\r\n"
      		+ "knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\r\n"
      		+ "the Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and\r\n"
      		+ "together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\r\n"
      		+ "armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\r\n"
      		+ "back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts\r\n"
      		+ "must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\r\n"
      		+ "saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed\r\n"
      		+ "the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the\r\n"
      		+ "hall:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we\r\n"
      		+ "destroyed them all!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Destroyed?” asked the Professor.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There’s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn’t turn up\r\n"
      		+ "by five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave Mrs. Harker\r\n"
      		+ "alone after sunset.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had been\r\n"
      		+ "consulting his pocket-book. “_Nota bene_, in Madam’s telegram he went\r\n"
      		+ "south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\r\n"
      		+ "only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\r\n"
      		+ "o’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only\r\n"
      		+ "suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\r\n"
      		+ "suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a\r\n"
      		+ "short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to\r\n"
      		+ "Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be\r\n"
      		+ "carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not\r\n"
      		+ "have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\r\n"
      		+ "we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your\r\n"
      		+ "arms! Be ready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\r\n"
      		+ "hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\r\n"
      		+ "dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and\r\n"
      		+ "adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\r\n"
      		+ "been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\r\n"
      		+ "accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be\r\n"
      		+ "renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once\r\n"
      		+ "laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\r\n"
      		+ "gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\r\n"
      		+ "just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\r\n"
      		+ "guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\r\n"
      		+ "Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\r\n"
      		+ "move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the\r\n"
      		+ "seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along\r\n"
      		+ "the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\r\n"
      		+ "he feared it.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past\r\n"
      		+ "us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something\r\n"
      		+ "so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed\r\n"
      		+ "to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was\r\n"
      		+ "Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\r\n"
      		+ "leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a\r\n"
      		+ "horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long\r\n"
      		+ "and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of\r\n"
      		+ "lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single\r\n"
      		+ "impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some\r\n"
      		+ "better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\r\n"
      		+ "we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\r\n"
      		+ "avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had\r\n"
      		+ "ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The\r\n"
      		+ "blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s\r\n"
      		+ "leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne\r\n"
      		+ "through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\r\n"
      		+ "making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold\r\n"
      		+ "fell out. The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a\r\n"
      		+ "moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife\r\n"
      		+ "aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a\r\n"
      		+ "protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I\r\n"
      		+ "felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\r\n"
      		+ "saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\r\n"
      		+ "by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of\r\n"
      		+ "hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\r\n"
      		+ "the Count’s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\r\n"
      		+ "of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\r\n"
      		+ "pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous\r\n"
      		+ "dive he swept under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\r\n"
      		+ "a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw\r\n"
      		+ "himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,\r\n"
      		+ "he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the\r\n"
      		+ "shivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the\r\n"
      		+ "sovereigns fell on the flagging.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up\r\n"
      		+ "the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\r\n"
      		+ "There he turned and spoke to us:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like\r\n"
      		+ "sheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think\r\n"
      		+ "you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is\r\n"
      		+ "just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your\r\n"
      		+ "girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and\r\n"
      		+ "others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my\r\n"
      		+ "jackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passed\r\n"
      		+ "quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\r\n"
      		+ "fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us\r\n"
      		+ "to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\r\n"
      		+ "him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he\r\n"
      		+ "fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His\r\n"
      		+ "very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You\r\n"
      		+ "follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For\r\n"
      		+ "me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\r\n"
      		+ "return.” As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\r\n"
      		+ "the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\r\n"
      		+ "remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\r\n"
      		+ "a match.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\r\n"
      		+ "lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,\r\n"
      		+ "bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\r\n"
      		+ "was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\r\n"
      		+ "of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to\r\n"
      		+ "recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\r\n"
      		+ "Professor when he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do\r\n"
      		+ "just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need\r\n"
      		+ "not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find\r\n"
      		+ "it; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke as\r\n"
      		+ "bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken\r\n"
      		+ "down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he\r\n"
      		+ "was thinking of his wife.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\r\n"
      		+ "waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\r\n"
      		+ "bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as\r\n"
      		+ "pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\r\n"
      		+ "in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke,\r\n"
      		+ "she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“Lay your\r\n"
      		+ "poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect\r\n"
      		+ "us if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor fellow groaned. There\r\n"
      		+ "was no place for words in his sublime misery.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us\r\n"
      		+ "all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry\r\n"
      		+ "people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense\r\n"
      		+ "of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less\r\n"
      		+ "miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to\r\n"
      		+ "our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and\r\n"
      		+ "although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\r\n"
      		+ "manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the\r\n"
      		+ "part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to\r\n"
      		+ "her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\r\n"
      		+ "protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,\r\n"
      		+ "till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up\r\n"
      		+ "to the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she\r\n"
      		+ "stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the\r\n"
      		+ "scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty\r\n"
      		+ "of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which\r\n"
      		+ "she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\r\n"
      		+ "teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\r\n"
      		+ "our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\r\n"
      		+ "we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\r\n"
      		+ "purity and faith, was outcast from God.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was\r\n"
      		+ "so full of love and tenderness, “Jonathan dear, and you all my true,\r\n"
      		+ "true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this\r\n"
      		+ "dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as\r\n"
      		+ "you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;\r\n"
      		+ "but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this\r\n"
      		+ "misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when\r\n"
      		+ "he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have\r\n"
      		+ "spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may\r\n"
      		+ "not hold your hands from his destruction.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As she spoke I could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, as\r\n"
      		+ "though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.\r\n"
      		+ "Instinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till his\r\n"
      		+ "knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\r\n"
      		+ "must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\r\n"
      		+ "than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing\r\n"
      		+ "his hand from hers as he spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\r\n"
      		+ "earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send\r\n"
      		+ "his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don’t say such things,\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just\r\n"
      		+ "think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\r\n"
      		+ "... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some\r\n"
      		+ "other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,\r\n"
      		+ "my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\r\n"
      		+ "had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\r\n"
      		+ "your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and\r\n"
      		+ "sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\r\n"
      		+ "of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\r\n"
      		+ "so many sorrows have come.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept\r\n"
      		+ "openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.\r\n"
      		+ "Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\r\n"
      		+ "round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned\r\n"
      		+ "to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\r\n"
      		+ "with their God.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\r\n"
      		+ "of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\r\n"
      		+ "She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\r\n"
      		+ "husband’s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,\r\n"
      		+ "I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at\r\n"
      		+ "hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.\r\n"
      		+ "When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\r\n"
      		+ "sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\r\n"
      		+ "poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us\r\n"
      		+ "shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,\r\n"
      		+ "for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go\r\n"

      		+ "There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief\r\n"
      		+ "that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must\r\n"
      		+ "now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step\r\n"
      		+ "was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one\r\n"

      		+ "dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was\r\n"
      		+ "like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Why?” I asked.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured\r\n"
      		+ "without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I\r\n"
      		+ "shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” I\r\n"
      		+ "went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing\r\n"
      		+ "me, he sprang to his feet.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’s room.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his\r\n"
      		+ "dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at\r\n"
      		+ "the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a\r\n"
      		+ "positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he\r\n"
      		+ "said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,\r\n"
      		+ "we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” Then\r\n"
      		+ "turning to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do for you? For at\r\n"
      		+ "this hour you do not want me for nothings.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn, for I\r\n"
      		+ "feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is\r\n"
      		+ "short!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\r\n"
      		+ "from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina\r\n"
      		+ "gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\r\n"
      		+ "like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually\r\n"
      		+ "her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of\r\n"
      		+ "her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few\r\n"
      		+ "more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was\r\n"
      		+ "covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she\r\n"
      		+ "did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and\r\n"
      		+ "her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to\r\n"
      		+ "impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.\r\n"
      		+ "They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the\r\n"
      		+ "foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The\r\n"
      		+ "stillness was broken by Van Helsing’s voice speaking in a low level tone\r\n"
      		+ "which would not break the current of her thoughts:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several\r\n"
      		+ "minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\r\n"
      		+ "staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room\r\n"
      		+ "was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed\r\n"
      		+ "just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse\r\n"
      		+ "itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it\r\n"
      		+ "were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the\r\n"
      		+ "same tone when reading her shorthand notes.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I do not know. It is all strange to me!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What do you see?”\r\n"

      		+ "“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other, trying to glean\r\n"
      		+ "something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came\r\n"
      		+ "quick:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\r\n"
      		+ "day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’s shoulders, and laid her\r\n"
      		+ "head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few\r\n"
      		+ "moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see\r\n"
      		+ "us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.\r\n"
      		+ "She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she\r\n"
      		+ "was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calm\r\n"

      		+ "thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we\r\n"

      		+ "forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but\r\n"
      		+ "that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the\r\n"
      		+ "Count’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce\r\n"

      		+ "think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would\r\n"
      		+ "say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and\r\n"
      		+ "we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a\r\n"
      		+ "little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters\r\n"
      		+ "between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he\r\n"
      		+ "would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or\r\n"

      		+ "and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with\r\n"
      		+ "us.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” He\r\n"
      		+ "took her hand and patted it as he replied:--\r\n"

      		+ "and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.\r\n"
      		+ "The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and\r\n"
      		+ "blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to\r\n"
      		+ "fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,\r\n"
      		+ "when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and\r\n"
      		+ "asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied\r\n"
      		+ "that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and\r\n"
      		+ "blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\r\n"
      		+ "with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\r\n"
      		+ "on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.\r\n"
      		+ "Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and\r\n"
      		+ "all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was\r\n"
      		+ "of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears\r\n"
      		+ "exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\r\n"
      		+ "picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up\r\n"
      		+ "and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any\r\n"
      		+ "of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship\r\n"
      		+ "went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the\r\n"
      		+ "river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for\r\n"
      		+ "our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\r\n"
      		+ "Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\r\n"
      		+ "we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope\r\n"
      		+ "is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\r\n"
      		+ "he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There\r\n"
      		+ "are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about\r\n"
      		+ "where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\r\n"
      		+ "invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in\r\n"
      		+ "Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\r\n"
      		+ "his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.\r\n"
      		+ "When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\r\n"
      		+ "have inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not\r\n"
      		+ "for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain\r\n"
      		+ "that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: “We have the\r\n"
      		+ "best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this\r\n"
      		+ "morning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should\r\n"
      		+ "pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that\r\n"
      		+ "he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,\r\n"
      		+ "at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\r\n"
      		+ "forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some\r\n"
      		+ "of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,\r\n"

      		+ "already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\r\n"
      		+ "time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\r\n"
      		+ "darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my\r\n"
      		+ "dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\r\n"
      		+ "in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his\r\n"
      		+ "own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\r\n"
      		+ "of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\r\n"

      		+ "what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\r\n"

      		+ "nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\r\n"
      		+ "some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\r\n"
      		+ "all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\r\n"
      		+ "world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.\r\n"
      		+ "There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\r\n"
      		+ "of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,\r\n"
      		+ "there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of\r\n"

      		+ "thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which\r\n"
      		+ "is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,\r\n"
      		+ "and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have\r\n"

      		+ "“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven\r\n"
      		+ "from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\r\n"

      		+ "the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a\r\n"
      		+ "ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater\r\n"

      		+ "_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for\r\n"
      		+ "each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more\r\n"
      		+ "general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience\r\n"
      		+ "again.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by\r\n"
      		+ "death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More\r\n"
      		+ "than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether\r\n"
      		+ "the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I\r\n"
      		+ "caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was\r\n"
      		+ "brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the\r\n"
      		+ "matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our\r\n"
      		+ "trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her\r\n"
      		+ "trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\r\n"
      		+ "recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to\r\n"
      		+ "meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of\r\n"
      		+ "action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\r\n"
      		+ "rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\r\n"
      		+ "that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’s tongue is tied. I _know_\r\n"
      		+ "that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\r\n"
      		+ "guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\r\n"
      		+ "cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\r\n"
      		+ "he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of\r\n"
      		+ "that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The\r\n"
      		+ "Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the\r\n"
      		+ "Vampire’s baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils\r\n"
      		+ "itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\r\n"
      		+ "a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my\r\n"
      		+ "instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a\r\n"
      		+ "terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same\r\n"
      		+ "power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think\r\n"
      		+ "further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall\r\n"

      		+ "_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\r\n"
      		+ "things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to\r\n"
      		+ "say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating\r\n"
      		+ "about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just\r\n"
      		+ "at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our\r\n"
      		+ "confidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran\r\n"
      		+ "through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\r\n"
      		+ "before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than\r\n"
      		+ "ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I\r\n"
      		+ "can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now\r\n"
      		+ "but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\r\n"
      		+ "without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\r\n"
      		+ "are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\r\n"
      		+ "often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she\r\n"
      		+ "wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If\r\n"
      		+ "it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\r\n"
      		+ "hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\r\n"
      		+ "have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\r\n"
      		+ "will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” I nodded\r\n"
      		+ "acquiescence; he went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\r\n"
      		+ "our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful\r\n"
      		+ "task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.\r\n"
      		+ "When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\r\n"
      		+ "to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\r\n"
      		+ "us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\r\n"
      		+ "at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\r\n"
      		+ "soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\r\n"
      		+ "to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at\r\n"
      		+ "any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the\r\n"
      		+ "effect was as I expected.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has\r\n"
      		+ "gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I\r\n"
      		+ "really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\r\n"
      		+ "experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a\r\n"
      		+ "message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\r\n"
      		+ "she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\r\n"
      		+ "without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each\r\n"
      		+ "other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own\r\n"
      		+ "part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was\r\n"
      		+ "much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we\r\n"
      		+ "agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\r\n"
      		+ "preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to\r\n"
      		+ "confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take\r\n"
      		+ "her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to\r\n"
      		+ "reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.\r\n"
      		+ "Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such\r\n"
      		+ "weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if\r\n"
      		+ "we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\r\n"
      		+ "then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite\r\n"
      		+ "safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate\r\n"
      		+ "be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\r\n"
      		+ "preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed\r\n"
      		+ "against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris\r\n"
      		+ "added:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\r\n"
      		+ "that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to\r\n"
      		+ "our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\r\n"
      		+ "trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\r\n"
      		+ "after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeater\r\n"
      		+ "apiece!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’s head is\r\n"
      		+ "level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\r\n"
      		+ "dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we\r\n"
      		+ "can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of\r\n"
      		+ "us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.\r\n"
      		+ "To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we\r\n"
      		+ "four can set out on our journey.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\r\n"
      		+ "us.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Of course!” answered the Professor quickly, “you must remain to take\r\n"

      		+ "could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\r\n"
      		+ "wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’s determination not\r\n"
      		+ "to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not\r\n"

      		+ "last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\r\n"

      		+ "evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\r\n"
      		+ "lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at\r\n"
      		+ "once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--\r\n"

      		+ "“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A\r\n"

      		+ "broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have\r\n"
      		+ "no right to make it.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\r\n"
      		+ "were like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.\r\n"
      		+ "You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\r\n"
      		+ "do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\r\n"
      		+ "from the promise.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\r\n"
      		+ "to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.\r\n"
      		+ "She said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for\r\n"
      		+ "the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or\r\n"
      		+ "implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she\r\n"
      		+ "solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said\r\n"
      		+ "solemnly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\r\n"

      		+ "that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went\r\n"
      		+ "for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\r\n"
      		+ "him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\r\n"
      		+ "opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest\r\n"
      		+ "duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than\r\n"
      		+ "any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” He paused,\r\n"
      		+ "embarrassed.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\r\n"
      		+ "coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me\r\n"
      		+ "I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by\r\n"
      		+ "wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.” God saw the look that\r\n"
      		+ "she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel\r\n"
      		+ "that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her\r\n"
      		+ "hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of\r\n"
      		+ "tears. She went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you\r\n"
      		+ "can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had\r\n"
      		+ "to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me\r\n"
      		+ "and so learn that which even I myself do not know.” Dr. Van Helsing said\r\n"
      		+ "very gravely:--\r\n"

      		+ "“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and\r\n"
      		+ "together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he had\r\n"
      		+ "spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen\r\n"
      		+ "back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up\r\n"
      		+ "the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing\r\n"
      		+ "motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within\r\n"
      		+ "a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.\r\n"
      		+ "He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a\r\n"
      		+ "new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony\r\n"
      		+ "to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are\r\n"
      		+ "warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be\r\n"
      		+ "ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor\r\n"
      		+ "paused before replying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified\r\n"
      		+ "the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall\r\n"
      		+ "fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the\r\n"
      		+ "superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was\r\n"
      		+ "man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,\r\n"
      		+ "when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we\r\n"
      		+ "shall open the box, and--and all will be well.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris. “When I see the box\r\n"
      		+ "I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand\r\n"
      		+ "men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” I\r\n"
      		+ "grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.\r\n"
      		+ "I think he understood my look; I hope he did.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God\r\n"
      		+ "bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or\r\n"
      		+ "pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,\r\n"
      		+ "indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things\r\n"

      		+ "let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch\r\n"
      		+ "on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us\r\n"

      		+ "Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to\r\n"
      		+ "understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;\r\n"
      		+ "when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing\r\n"
      		+ "or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition\r\n"
      		+ "begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts\r\n"
      		+ "till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with\r\n"
      		+ "the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of\r\n"
      		+ "negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the\r\n"
      		+ "signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a\r\n"
      		+ "violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few\r\n"
      		+ "minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning\r\n"
      		+ "her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,\r\n"

      		+ "“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,\r\n"

      		+ "her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “In\r\n"
      		+ "the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in\r\n"
      		+ "store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me\r\n"

      		+ "woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate\r\n"
      		+ "at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.\r\n"

      		+ "“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before\r\n"
      		+ "the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I\r\n"
      		+ "once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you\r\n"

      		+ "in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be\r\n"
      		+ "done, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the\r\n"
      		+ "certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\r\n"
      		+ "blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” We were all\r\n"
      		+ "silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The\r\n"
      		+ "faces of the others were set and Harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he\r\n"
      		+ "guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note the\r\n"
      		+ "quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all\r\n"
      		+ "seriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know,” she went\r\n"
      		+ "on quickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’s, and you\r\n"
      		+ "can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?” She looked\r\n"
      		+ "again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quincey\r\n"
      		+ "seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell\r\n"
      		+ "you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this\r\n"
      		+ "connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,\r\n"
      		+ "my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but it was low and\r\n"
      		+ "strained.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that\r\n"
      		+ "I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,\r\n"
      		+ "without a moment’s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;\r\n"
      		+ "or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her\r\n"
      		+ "and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as a man should to\r\n"
      		+ "win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and\r\n"
      		+ "dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty\r\n"
      		+ "that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\r\n"
      		+ "certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\r\n"
      		+ "come!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,\r\n"
      		+ "bending over, she kissed his hand.\r\n"

      		+ "“I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing.\r\n"

      		+ "“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to\r\n"
      		+ "take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her\r\n"
      		+ "wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"

      		+ "all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all\r\n"
      		+ "time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed\r\n"
      		+ "their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the\r\n"
      		+ "hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because\r\n"

      		+ "the great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start\r\n"
      		+ "for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came from\r\n"
      		+ "Mrs. Harker.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“How on earth do you know?” said Art.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\r\n"
      		+ "does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\r\n"
      		+ "always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\r\n"
      		+ "husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\r\n"
      		+ "the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\r\n"
      		+ "Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\r\n"
      		+ "learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\r\n"
      		+ "as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\r\n"
      		+ "head: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\r\n"
      		+ "if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\r\n"
      		+ "regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\r\n"
      		+ "Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\r\n"
      		+ "tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\r\n"
      		+ "you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\r\n"
      		+ "letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\r\n"
      		+ "just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\r\n"
      		+ "his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\r\n"
      		+ "smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\r\n"
      		+ "with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\r\n"
      		+ "may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\r\n"
      		+ "with Madam to make report.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\r\n"
      		+ "had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and\r\n"
      		+ "shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\r\n"
      		+ "from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!”\r\n"
      		+ "The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\r\n"
      		+ "each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\r\n"
      		+ "time, however.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\r\n"
      		+ "Harker’s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\r\n"
      		+ "was shut upon her he said to me:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“We mean the same! speak out!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\r\n"
      		+ "deceive us.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\r\n"
      		+ "you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\r\n"
      		+ "but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\r\n"
      		+ "words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\r\n"
      		+ "the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\r\n"
      		+ "mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\r\n"
      		+ "with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\r\n"
      		+ "then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\r\n"
      		+ "eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\r\n"
      		+ "Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\r\n"
      		+ "but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\r\n"
      		+ "so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\r\n"
      		+ "have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\r\n"
      		+ "come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\r\n"
      		+ "that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\r\n"
      		+ "therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\r\n"
      		+ "She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\r\n"
      		+ "we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\r\n"
      		+ "brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have\r\n"
      		+ "a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\r\n"
      		+ "altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\r\n"
      		+ "learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\r\n"
      		+ "feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\r\n"
      		+ "just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\r\n"
      		+ "himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\r\n"
      		+ "the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\r\n"
      		+ "forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\r\n"
      		+ "of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\r\n"
      		+ "brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\r\n"
      		+ "thumb he said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,\r\n"
      		+ "dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\r\n"
      		+ "think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\r\n"
      		+ "let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\r\n"
      		+ "where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\r\n"
      		+ "at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\r\n"
      		+ "strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the “Ugly Duck” of my friend\r\n"
      		+ "Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\r\n"
      		+ "sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\r\n"
      		+ "read here what Jonathan have written:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\r\n"
      		+ "his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\r\n"
      		+ "beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\r\n"
      		+ "alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\r\n"
      		+ "since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count’s child-thought see\r\n"
      		+ "nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my\r\n"
      		+ "man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\r\n"
      		+ "from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\r\n"
      		+ "it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\r\n"
      		+ "yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then\r\n"
      		+ "pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\r\n"
      		+ "and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\r\n"
      		+ "leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\r\n"
      		+ "study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ You, John, yes; for it is\r\n"
      		+ "a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not\r\n"
      		+ "but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad\r\n"
      		+ "universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\r\n"
      		+ "in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\r\n"
      		+ "from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to\r\n"
      		+ "be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true\r\n"
      		+ "criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\r\n"
      		+ "This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\r\n"
      		+ "resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\r\n"
      		+ "child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\r\n"
      		+ "also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\r\n"
      		+ "have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\r\n"
      		+ "by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\r\n"
      		+ "him the ground to start from to do more. ‘_Dos pou sto_,’ said\r\n"
      		+ "Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once,\r\n"
      		+ "is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\r\n"
      		+ "the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\r\n"
      		+ "just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\r\n"
      		+ "opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for\r\n"
      		+ "Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\r\n"
      		+ "those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\r\n"
      		+ "His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\r\n"
      		+ "unconsciously, as she spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\r\n"
      		+ "so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\r\n"
      		+ "Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\r\n"
      		+ "clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\r\n"
      		+ "lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\r\n"
      		+ "‘tight place,’ he went back to his own country from the land he had\r\n"
      		+ "tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\r\n"
      		+ "for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\r\n"
      		+ "So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\r\n"
      		+ "hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\r\n"
      		+ "the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\r\n"
      		+ "from Turkey Land.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,\r\n"
      		+ "enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\r\n"
      		+ "said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\r\n"
      		+ "consultation:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to\r\n"
      		+ "her again, he said with keen expectation:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;\r\n"
      		+ "John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.\r\n"
      		+ "Speak, without fear!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\r\n"
      		+ "and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\r\n"
      		+ "purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\r\n"
      		+ "leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\r\n"
      		+ "safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\r\n"
      		+ "from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\r\n"
      		+ "night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\r\n"
      		+ "is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\r\n"
      		+ "is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\r\n"
      		+ "his ends.” The Professor stood up:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\r\n"
      		+ "whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\r\n"
      		+ "Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\r\n"
      		+ "But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\r\n"
      		+ "God’s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\r\n"
      		+ "his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\r\n"
      		+ "in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\r\n"
      		+ "is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\r\n"
      		+ "many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\r\n"
      		+ "sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\r\n"
      		+ "there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\r\n"
      		+ "terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\r\n"
      		+ "in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\r\n"
      		+ "sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\r\n"
      		+ "and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\r\n"
      		+ "suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\r\n"
      		+ "it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\r\n"
      		+ "knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\r\n"
      		+ "that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\r\n"
      		+ "hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\r\n"
      		+ "ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\r\n"
      		+ "hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\r\n"
      		+ "and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\r\n"
      		+ "you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”\r\n"

      		+ "had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\r\n"

      		+ "for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\r\n"
      		+ "Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\r\n"
      		+ "more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\r\n"
      		+ "necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\r\n"
      		+ "this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\r\n"
      		+ "resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\r\n"
      		+ "steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\r\n"
      		+ "men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\r\n"
      		+ "the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\r\n"
      		+ "There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\r\n"
      		+ "along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\r\n"
      		+ "blowing upon me.”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\r\n"
      		+ "on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\r\n"
      		+ "weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\r\n"
      		+ "Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\r\n"
      		+ "Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\r\n"
      		+ "was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\r\n"
      		+ "passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\r\n"
      		+ "sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!” We\r\n"
      		+ "could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\r\n"
      		+ "tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his\r\n"
      		+ "earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\r\n"
      		+ "hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\r\n"
      		+ "not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\r\n"
      		+ "in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\r\n"
      		+ "at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\r\n"
      		+ "be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\r\n"
      		+ "may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\r\n"
      		+ "shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\r\n"
      		+ "We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\r\n"
      		+ "on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\r\n"

      		+ "than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\r\n"
      		+ "so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\r\n"
      		+ "soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\r\n"
      		+ "reply:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\r\n"

      		+ "came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\r\n"
      		+ "arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and\r\n"
      		+ "he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\r\n"

      		+ "Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid\r\n"
      		+ "her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that\r\n"
      		+ "she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But\r\n"
      		+ "I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the\r\n"
      		+ "fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round\r\n"
      		+ "where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and\r\n"

      		+ "clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\r\n"

      		+ "“Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\r\n"

      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\r\n"
      		+ "could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be\r\n"

      		+ "the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was\r\n"

      		+ "about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying\r\n"
      		+ "sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of\r\n"
      		+ "some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the\r\n"
      		+ "snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with\r\n"
      		+ "trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses\r\n"
      		+ "whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to\r\n"
      		+ "fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\r\n"
      		+ "ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of\r\n"
      		+ "the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and\r\n"
      		+ "all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’s\r\n"

      		+ "began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy\r\n"
      		+ "glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses\r\n"
      		+ "cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even\r\n"
      		+ "the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I\r\n"
      		+ "feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and\r\n"
      		+ "circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when\r\n"
      		+ "I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held\r\n"
      		+ "me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low\r\n"
      		+ "it was:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and\r\n"
      		+ "looking in her eyes, said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, low\r\n"
      		+ "and unreal, and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them\r\n"
      		+ "than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\r\n"
      		+ "wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.\r\n"
      		+ "Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\r\n"
      		+ "wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\r\n"
      		+ "the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not\r\n"
      		+ "take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me\r\n"
      		+ "in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when\r\n"
      		+ "they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the\r\n"
      		+ "bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\r\n"
      		+ "lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\r\n"
      		+ "through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\r\n"
      		+ "her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\r\n"
      		+ "of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my poor\r\n"
      		+ "Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the\r\n"
      		+ "terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\r\n"
      		+ "heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I\r\n"
      		+ "seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the\r\n"
      		+ "Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and\r\n"
      		+ "laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for\r\n"
      		+ "I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not\r\n"
      		+ "approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within\r\n"

      		+ "him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\r\n"
      		+ "with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\r\n"
      		+ "hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter; and\r\n"
      		+ "if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our\r\n"
      		+ "furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\r\n"
      		+ "forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\r\n"
      		+ "repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\r\n"
      		+ "not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\r\n"
      		+ "reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\r\n"
      		+ "of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the\r\n"
      		+ "rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\r\n"
      		+ "more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\r\n"
      		+ "to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\r\n"
      		+ "snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\r\n"
      		+ "were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\r\n"
      		+ "white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\r\n"
      		+ "kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\r\n"
      		+ "off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\r\n"
      		+ "group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\r\n"
      		+ "long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail\r\n"
      		+ "wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\r\n"
      		+ "snow as they were, I could see from the men’s clothes that they were\r\n"
      		+ "peasants or gypsies of some kind.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\r\n"
      		+ "felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\r\n"
      		+ "well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\r\n"
      		+ "there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\r\n"
      		+ "pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\r\n"
      		+ "however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\r\n"
      		+ "the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\r\n"
      		+ "night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“At least you shall be safe here from _him_!” He took the glasses from\r\n"
      		+ "me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\r\n"
      		+ "“See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\r\n"
      		+ "galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow\r\n"
      		+ "voice:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s will be\r\n"
      		+ "done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\r\n"
      		+ "landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\r\n"
      		+ "glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\r\n"
      		+ "south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\r\n"
      		+ "blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\r\n"
      		+ "and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\r\n"
      		+ "At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\r\n"
      		+ "I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\r\n"
      		+ "break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\r\n"
      		+ "of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\r\n"
      		+ "the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\r\n"
      		+ "and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\r\n"
      		+ "laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\r\n"
      		+ "opening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said. “When the\r\n"
      		+ "time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got out my revolver\r\n"
      		+ "ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\r\n"
      		+ "louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\r\n"
      		+ "It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\r\n"
      		+ "and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\r\n"
      		+ "towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\r\n"
      		+ "see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\r\n"
      		+ "numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\r\n"
      		+ "fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\r\n"
      		+ "circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length before us;\r\n"
      		+ "but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\r\n"
      		+ "clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\r\n"
      		+ "late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\r\n"
      		+ "with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\r\n"
      		+ "sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\r\n"
      		+ "than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\r\n"
      		+ "bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\r\n"
      		+ "and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\r\n"
      		+ "had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\r\n"
      		+ "the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\r\n"
      		+ "party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\r\n"
      		+ "not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\r\n"
      		+ "seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\r\n"
      		+ "and lower on the mountain tops.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\r\n"
      		+ "our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\r\n"
      		+ "that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\r\n"
      		+ "presence.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my Jonathan’s,\r\n"
      		+ "raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’ strong resolute\r\n"
      		+ "tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\r\n"
      		+ "there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\r\n"
      		+ "spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\r\n"
      		+ "and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\r\n"
      		+ "other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\r\n"
      		+ "horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\r\n"
      		+ "companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\r\n"
      		+ "forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\r\n"
      		+ "unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\r\n"
      		+ "Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\r\n"
      		+ "Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\r\n"
      		+ "up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\r\n"
      		+ "gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\r\n"
      		+ "himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\r\n"
      		+ "front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\r\n"
      		+ "tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\r\n"
      		+ "For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\r\n"
      		+ "and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\r\n"
      		+ "Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\r\n"
      		+ "upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\r\n"
      		+ "surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\r\n"
      		+ "parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\r\n"
      		+ "formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\r\n"
      		+ "shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\r\n"
      		+ "order.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\r\n"
      		+ "of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\r\n"
      		+ "evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\r\n"
      		+ "should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\r\n"
      		+ "levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\r\n"
      		+ "the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\r\n"
      		+ "attention. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\r\n"
      		+ "purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\r\n"
      		+ "cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\r\n"
      		+ "cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\r\n"
      		+ "box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\r\n"
      		+ "Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\r\n"
      		+ "Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\r\n"
      		+ "with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\r\n"
      		+ "seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\r\n"
      		+ "they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\r\n"
      		+ "I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\r\n"
      		+ "beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\r\n"
      		+ "with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\r\n"
      		+ "spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\r\n"
      		+ "as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\r\n"
      		+ "attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\r\n"
      		+ "the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\r\n"
      		+ "lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\r\n"
      		+ "the top of the box was thrown back.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\r\n"
      		+ "and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\r\n"
      		+ "no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\r\n"
      		+ "shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\r\n"
      		+ "lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\r\n"
      		+ "the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\r\n"
      		+ "image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\r\n"
      		+ "knew too well.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\r\n"
      		+ "turned to triumph.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’s great knife.\r\n"
      		+ "I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\r\n"
      		+ "moment Mr. Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\r\n"
      		+ "drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\r\n"
      		+ "our sight.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\r\n"
      		+ "dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\r\n"
      		+ "could have imagined might have rested there.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\r\n"
      		+ "of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\r\n"
      		+ "setting sun.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\r\n"
      		+ "disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\r\n"
      		+ "if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\r\n"
      		+ "leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\r\n"
      		+ "which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\r\n"
      		+ "us alone.\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\r\n"
      		+ "hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\r\n"
      		+ "flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\r\n"
      		+ "two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\r\n"
      		+ "head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\r\n"
      		+ "in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\r\n"
      		+ "my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he cried\r\n"
      		+ "suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, “It was\r\n"
      		+ "worth for this to die! Look! look!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\r\n"
      		+ "fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\r\n"
      		+ "the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” broke from all\r\n"
      		+ "as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\r\n"
      		+ "spoke:--\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "“Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\r\n"
      		+ "more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”\r\n"
      		+ "\r\n"
      		+ "And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\r\n"
